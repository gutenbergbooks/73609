  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One of the large north galleries approached from the Bird Gallery
is devoted to the exhibition of the extensive Class of Mollusca.
Specimens of the types of all the principal divisions of this Class
are exhibited, either entire and preserved in spirit, or as models.
However, as not the animals, but their shells have always been a
favourite object of study, and a popular source of pleasure to
collectors, the exhibition of the species of shells has been made as
complete as the space of this Gallery admitted. It has thus proved
adequate for the requirements of the majority of visitors and students
who consult this Collection. A separate series of British Shells is
exhibited in some small table-cases along the west wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Gallery also contains the exhibited series of Polyzoa,
Brachiopoda, and Tunicata.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Starfish Gallery, so called from one of the best-known types
of the Echinoderma, contains an exhibition of the animals of this
Class, as well as of the somewhat heterogeneous assemblage of
creatures which are comprised under the popular name of Worms
(<i>Vermes</i>). These animals possess greater attraction to students of
Natural History than to the general public, and many, from their
small size or the soft nature of their body, are not suitable for
exhibition. Therefore no attempt has been made to show more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>a carefully selected number of the types of the larger groups. But
the exhibition of very complete series, supplemented by models or
figures, to illustrate the remarkable life history of some of these
animals, also of specimens of the Worms which possess a special
interest from their relation to man, render this Gallery particularly
instructive to the student.</p>

<p class='c007'>This guide has been prepared by Mr. E. A. Smith, Mr. F. J.
Bell, and Mr. R. Kirkpatrick, who have special charge of the
collections described.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, thanks are due to Messrs. A. &#38; C. Black, Messrs.
F. Warne &#38; Co., Messrs. Macmillan &#38; Co., Crosby Lockwood &#38;
Son, and the Linnean Society for kindly allowing the use of <i>clichés</i>

  <h2 class='c005'>GENERAL NOTES ON MOLLUSCA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Mollusca constitute one of the principal divisions of the
Animal Kingdom, and include such animals as the Octopus, Cuttlefish,
Snail, Slug, Whelk, Cockle, and Oyster.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definition.</div>

<p class='c007'>They may be characterized as soft, cold-blooded animals, without
distinctly marked external division into segments (as in Worms);
their cerebral ganglia (the centre of the nervous system) lie above
the commencement of the gullet, and are connected with the inferior
ganglia by nerve-chords. Their heart consists of two or more
chambers, and is situated on the dorsal side of the animal; it drives
the blood into spaces between the various organs of the body. Only
the Cephalopods possess internal cartilages, but all are without a
bony internal skeleton; in the majority this is compensated by an
external hardened shell which is formed (secreted) by the outer
covering of the animal termed the <i>mantle</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The
shell.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The shell may consist
of two parts (valves), as in the Oyster, or may be single, as in
the Whelk and Limpet, or composed of a series of plates, as in
the “Coat-of-mail” shells or <i>Chitons</i>: when well developed it is
hardened by a rich deposit of carbonate of lime; but it may be
gelatinous, as in <i>Cymbulia</i>, or altogether absent, as in <i>Octopus</i>; it
may cover and protect the body, as in the Oyster, lie within the
folds of the mantle, as in the Sea-hares (<i>Aplysiidæ</i>), or it may be
quite internal, as in the horny “pen” of the Squid. It may be
elongated, as in the Elephant Tooth-shell (<i>Dentalium</i>), cup-shaped,
as in the Limpet, or spirally coiled, as in the Snail.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the animal.</div>

<p class='c007'>The mantle may form a free fold on either side of the body, as
in the Bivalves, or it may become largely attached to the body-wall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>as in the Snail or the Slug, and so give rise to an air-chamber,
which, when its walls are richly supplied with blood, serves as a
lung. The ventral surface of Molluscs is produced into the so-called
“foot,” which may be very variously modified. The foot
may be more or less hatchet-shaped, or curved and capable of serving
as a leaping-organ, or sole-shaped and adapted for creeping; its
margins may be produced into elongated processes, as the so-called
arms of the Octopus, eight in number and provided with suckers,
or of the Nautilus, where the arms are much more numerous, but
shorter and without suckers. In the Cephalopods, also, another
part of the foot may fold over from either side and form a median
funnel, through which the water of respiration is driven outwards,
causing the animal to move in the opposite direction—this part of
the foot having, therefore, still the function of an organ of locomotion.
By means of their muscular foot the <i>Solenidæ</i>, or Razor-shells,
burrow in the sand, the Pond-Snails (<i>Limnæidæ</i>) crawl on
aquatic plants and swim reversed on the surface of the water, the
Limpet clings to the rock, and the Cockles and <i>Trigonias</i> take
surprising leaps.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The operculum.</div>

<p class='c007'>Upon the upper surface of the foot, in many Gastropods, a flat
hard structure termed the <i>operculum</i> is situated, which, when the
animal is retracted, partly or entirely closes the aperture of the
shell. In some cases, as in the <i>Turbos</i>, it is very strong and
of a stony nature, but in most instances it is horny. It is
differently constructed in distinct families: it may be annular
and multispiral, annular and paucispiral, subannular and ovate, or
subannular and unguiculate. In the <i>Nerites</i> it is shelly, somewhat
semicircular, closes the aperture of the shell, and is furnished with
a stout projection on the straight edge, fitting like a hinge under
the inner lip of the shell. A series of <i>opercula</i> is exhibited in side
table-case C.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The breathing-organs.</div>

<p class='c007'>Thread-like processes on either side of the body, the so-called
gill-filaments, often unite with those in front of and behind them,
and so give rise to plates; these, when well developed, are best
seen in the division to which the Oyster and the Mussel belong,
and which, therefore, has been called the division of the plate-gilled
Molluscs, or <i>Lamellibranchia</i>. Where the body is coiled or twisted
on itself, as so often happens, the gills of one side may be altogether
lost. Sometimes, as in <i>Phyllirhoë</i>, when the body is small and its
wall thin, the gills (<i>ctenidia</i>) disappear altogether, and there is no
special breathing-organ; in others the loss of the gill is compensated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>by the formation by the mantle of a lung; this is most often seen in
the forms that live on land.</p>

<p class='c007'>But these so-called gills may have other functions: in the Lamellibranchs,
where there is no head and no special means by which the
creature can obtain food, the delicate waving filaments or <i>cilia</i> with
which they are covered cause currents in the surrounding water, by
means of which minute organisms are brought to the mouth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The radula.</div>

<p class='c007'>All Molluscs, except the Lamellibranchs, have a very remarkable
structure developed in the floor of their mouth-cavities; on a basis
of cartilage, which may be moved backwards and forwards by muscles,
there is developed a horny plate, which may be of considerable length,
and which has its upper surface covered with a number of more or
less fine, flattened, or spiny outgrowths, which are known as teeth.
This is the <i>odontophore</i>, <i>tongue</i>, <i>radula</i>, or lingual ribbon (see fig. 3).<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The eyes.</div>

<p class='c007'>Eyes may be absent, as in nearly all the headless Lamellibranchs;
but in other Molluscs they are generally present, and may be more or
less well developed. An instructive series of stages is exhibited by the
Cephalopoda. In <i>Nautilus</i> the eye remains an open pit; in <i>Ommatostrephes</i>
two chambers appear, the anterior of which is bounded
posteriorly by the lens, and is open to the exterior, so that sea-water
enters it; in <i>Sepia</i>, finally, the anterior chamber becomes closed in
front. We may observe that the eyes of all Cephalopods are at
first pit-like, or pass through a stage which is permanent in <i>Nautilus</i>,
one of the geologically oldest types.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cephalic eyes have recently been noticed in <i>Mytilus</i> and <i>Avicula</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eyes of a more complicated structure, which are modified tentacles,
are sometimes found on the edges of the mantle in Lamellibranchs
(e.g. <i>Pecten</i>); these eyes resemble those of Vertebrates,
and differ from those of most invertebrate animals in having the
fibres of the optic nerve entering the distal and not the proximal
ends of the retinal cells. Eyes of a similar construction are to be
found on the back of the shellless <i>Oncidium</i>, and may be about
one hundred in number.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eyes of a remarkable character on the shells of some of the
Chitons appear to be modified from tactile organs, and are innervated
like the ordinary molluscan eye; they sometimes occur in
enormous numbers, more than ten thousand being present on one
animal (see wax model, Case 2).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Organ of hearing.</div>

<p class='c007'>In Cephalopods the ear, like the eye, is known to make its first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>appearance in the form of an open pit, the mouth of which gradually
closes up, leaving only a narrow slit in communication with the
exterior. It is probable that in many forms the so-called ear is an
organ by means of which the mollusc becomes acquainted with
changes in the surface over which it is passing; it is often found
deeply imbedded in the substance of the foot, where it forms a
closed vesicle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sense of smell.</div>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt that the carnivorous Gastropoda are gifted
with a sense of smell, and throughout the series we observe patches
of modified cells of the body-wall (the <i>osphradium</i>) which serve
either as olfactory organs or as an apparatus for testing the nature
of the water of respiration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The sexes and reproduction.</div>

<p class='c007'>The sexes are distinct in the most highly organized Mollusca,
but are united in the same individual in some of the lower forms,
such as Land-Snails, the <i>Opisthobranchia</i> (including the Bubble-Shells,
Sea-Slugs, &#38;c.), and in some Bivalves. The reproduction of Mollusca
is in all cases effected by means of eggs. In some instances the
young are actually hatched within the oviduct of the parent, as in
the Freshwater Snails (<i>Vivipara</i>); and apparently in most Bivalves
the eggs are also retained within the valves until hatched.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ova of many molluscs are deposited in masses enclosed in
capsules. Some of them are very wonderful and complicated
structures. Those of the Cuttles and their allies are clustered
like grapes, each capsule containing but a single embryo; but in
the Calamaries or Squids they form a radiating mass of elongated
sacks, each containing from thirty to two hundred eggs, and it
has been estimated that one of the spawn-clusters of the Common
Squid (<i>Loligo vulgaris</i>) contains as many as 40,000 ova. Everybody
knows the spawn-cases of the Common Whelk, found so abundantly
on the sea-beach, consisting of a large number of yellowish capsules,
heaped one upon another and forming an irregularly rounded mass.
As many as five or six hundred capsules may be piled together in
a single heap, each capsule containing several hundred eggs, of
which perhaps only thirty or forty are hatched.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other genera, as <i>Tethys</i>, <i>Doris</i>, <i>Eolis</i>, &#38;c., the eggs are
contained in a spirally rolled ribbon or strap-like structure; and
some of the <i>Naticæ</i> build a somewhat similar capsule, composed of
the eggs cemented together by sand and a gelatinous material, the
whole forming two-thirds of a circle narrowed at the upper part.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terrestrial Molluscs deposit, in comparison with their marine
relations, but very few eggs. They are sometimes covered by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>thin soft skin, but in certain groups, such as the large South-American
<i>Strophochili</i> and the African <i>Achatinæ</i>, which include the
largest of known land-molluscs, they are protected by a hardened
calcareous shell, in some instances fully an inch in diameter. The
freshwater forms (<i>Limnæa</i> and <i>Physa</i>) deposit from thirty to a
hundred eggs enveloped in a gelatinous mass.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of eggs produced by some Bivalves is enormous.
The Common Oyster is said to produce a million or more, and the
American variety ten, or even sixty, times as many. Some of the
River-Mussels are also very prolific, as many as two millions being
sometimes the product of a single individual. A small series of
the eggs of Land-Snails and of the egg-capsules of some marine
Gastropods is exhibited in side table-case C at the side of the
Gallery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ova of Mollusca may be gradually developed into the form
of the parent, or there may be a free-swimming larva, which has
a circlet of cilia near the anterior pole of its body (so-called
“Veliger” larvæ), or there may be special larvæ, as in the case of
the Freshwater Mussel, the “Glochidium,” as it is called, which
has a toothed bivalve shell by which it can fix itself to fishes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Duration of life.</div>

<p class='c007'>The limits of age of molluscs has been definitely ascertained in
a few instances only. Most Land-Snails probably live about two
years, although in confinement some have been kept alive for a
much longer time. Some of the marine forms live for a considerable
period, the Common Oyster not attaining full growth until about
five years old, after which it may continue to live for many years.
The Giant Clam, a specimen of which is placed in the upright cases
near the entrance to the Gallery, must, one would think, have a very
long existence, judging from the size and thickness of the shell.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hibernation
and
torpidity.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
All terrestrial molluscs hibernate in cold climates, hiding themselves
away in the ground between roots and similar sheltered places.
In tropical countries some assume a state of torpidity (æstivate)
during the hottest and driest season of the year, closing up the
aperture of their shells with a temporary lid or door (epiphragm),
in order to resist the dryness of the atmosphere. Some of these
“summer-sleepers” are endowed with a remarkable tenacity of life.
An Australian Pond-Mussel has been known to live a year after
being removed from the water; several Land-Snails have revived
after a captivity of from two to five years, without any food whatever.
One of the most remarkable instances of this kind occurred
in the British Museum. A specimen of <i>Helix desertorum</i>, a common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Desert-Snail from Egypt, was fixed to a tablet in March 1846, and
in the same month of the year 1850 it was discovered to be alive.
It must have come out of its shell in the interval, and finding it
was unable to crawl away, had again retired within it, closing the
aperture with a new epiphragm, but leaving traces of slime upon
the tablet, which led to its immersion
in water and subsequent revival,
having passed a period of
four years in a dry museum without
the smallest particle of food.
The actual specimen is here figured,

<div class='sidenote'>Economic uses.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>economic</i> uses of molluscs
to man are manifold, and will be
mentioned in the course of the description
of the several families; but here may be the place to
direct the attention of visitors to side table-cases B and D at the
side of the room, containing some specimens of articles manufactured
from shells, such as cameos, flowers, bracelets, brooches, &#38;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Geological history.</div>

<p class='c007'>Mollusca made their appearance on the globe at a very early
epoch in the history of the development of animal life, a large
number of fossil forms, such as <i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Lituites</i>, <i>Orthoceras</i>, &#38;c.,
being found in the oldest Palæozoic formations. Probably all these
belonged to the <i>Tetrabranchia</i>, of which one descendant only, the
Pearly Nautilus, has survived to our period. Some Gastropods
and Bivalves coexisted with those ancient Tetrabranchs; but these
types abounded more in the later geological epochs, many Tertiary
forms being undistinguishable from species which now exist.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General distribution.</div>

<p class='c007'>The greater number of Mollusca are inhabitants of the sea,
some passing their whole life at the surface hundreds or thousands
of miles away from land; others at the bottom of the ocean at all
depths, some having been dredged at five miles from the surface.
Many are found in much shallower water, and a large number
between tide-marks. Rivers and lakes furnish an immense variety
of forms, and vast numbers live on land in all situations—on
mountains, in valleys, forests, and deserts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Molluscs are either animal or vegetable-feeders, the former
preying principally upon other members of their own class.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>Class I.—AMPHINEURA.</h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cases 1–3.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Molluscs of this class are characterized by bilateral symmetry.
The head and arms are situated at the opposite extremities of the
elongated body, the gills, genital ducts and circulatory organs being
paired and similar on both sides. The first order belonging to this
division, the Polyplacophora, includes the “Coat-of-mail shells,” or
“Sea-woodlice” (<i>Chitonidæ</i>). They have their back armed with
eight shelly plates which overlap one another like tiles, and, like
woodlice, have the power of rolling themselves into a ball. These
plates are imbedded at the sides into the fleshy mantle, beneath
which, on each side of the foot, are arranged the gills. A Chiton
differs in many respects from other Mollusca. It has a shell like an
Isopod Crustacean, a heart down the back like a sea-worm, symmetrical
organs of reproduction on each side like the bivalves, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>head and crawling foot like a true Limpet, and a posterior anal
orifice. These several anatomical peculiarities at one time induced certain
eminent authorities to hesitate in considering them molluscs; but
now that the development from the egg has been investigated, their
association with the Mollusca may be considered definitely settled.</p>

<div id='i_p008'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_p008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Chitons are found in all parts of the world, the finest inhabiting
tropical countries. They live chiefly on rocks and under stones at
low-water or at moderate depths; but a few forms have been discovered
by the ‘Challenger’ Expedition at depths exceeding 2000
fathoms. The numerous sections of the group are principally distinguished
by differences in the edges of the plates or valves which
are inserted in the mantle, and in the different kinds of ornamentation
upon the upper surface of the mantle-border. This, in some
species, is quite smooth, in others covered with a dense mass of
minute grains or scales, and in others armed with short prickly
spines. In the giant <i>Cryptochiton</i> of Kamtschatka the plates are
entirely covered over by the thick leathery granular mantle, and in
another set, <i>Cryptoplax</i>, which consists of long slug-like animals, the
plates are very small, and placed at intervals along the back.</p>

<p class='c007'>About five hundred living species are known, and about one-fourth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>that number has been found fossil from the Silurian age
downwards.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Case 3.</div>

<p class='c007'>The second order of Amphineura, namely, the Aplacophora,
comprises a few somewhat worm-like Molluscs which are devoid of a
shell, but have instead the dorsal surface more or less studded with
numerous minute calcareous spines or spicules. <i>Neomenia</i>, <i>Proneomenia</i>,
<i>Chætoderma</i> are genera belonging to this order.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>Class II.—GASTROPODA.</h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cases 4–135.</div>

<p class='c007'>In contradistinction to the preceding class these Molluscs are
asymmetrical, especially in respect of the gills and the spiral coiling
of the viscera and most of the shells. They may be divided into
two sections, <i>Streptoneura</i> and <i>Euthyneura</i>, distinguished by differences
in the arrangement of the visceral nerve-loop.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Section <span class='sc'>Streptoneura</span>.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cases 4–94.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Molluscs of this section are bisexual and furnished with a
shell, and generally with an operculum. The gills are in front of
the heart and the visceral nerve-loop is twisted into a figure of 8.
The section contains two groups or orders, Scutibranchia and
Pectinibranchia.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>Order 1.—<span class='sc'>Scutibranchia.</span></h5>

<p class='c017'>The Scutibranchia have a free bipectinate gill, or the gill may
be absent (<i>Lepeta</i>, <i>Helicina</i>), and generally exhibit traces of bilateral
symmetry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Case 4.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Acmæidæ</i> are called False Limpets, because, although the
shells are identical with the true Limpets, the animals differ in
having only a small gill on the left side of the neck, whilst the
<i>Patellæ</i> have the gills greatly developed all round the sides of the
foot. Both the true and the false Limpets are littoral and found
on rocks between tide-marks. They have the power of excavating
the surface to which they attach themselves, and adhere so firmly
that it is easier to break the shell than detach the animal. The
largest known Limpet (<i>Patella (Ancistromesus) mexicana</i>, case 7) inhabits
the west coast of Central America, its shell having sometimes
a length of 12 inches. The Limpets are vegetable-feeders and fond
of seaweeds of various kinds, which they rasp with their remarkable
spiny tongues. That of the common English Limpet (<i>P. vulgata</i>,
Fig. 3) is longer than the shell itself, and armed with as many as
1920 glassy hooks in 160 rows of twelve teeth each. The Limpet
is commonly used for bait in the sea-fishing off the Scottish coast,
and vast quantities are consumed as food in some parts of Ireland.
Some Limpets, such as <i>P. compressa</i>, <i>P. mytilina</i>, etc., are found on
the stems of floating seaweeds, and have the shells usually thinner
and smoother than the Rock-Limpets, which have to resist the fury
of the breaking waves.</p>

resemble in external shape ordinary Limpets, but are perforated at
or near the apex, or more or less slit at the front margin. The
hole or slit gives passage to a tubular fold of the mantle, through
which the water apparently flows to the gills. The largest species
are from California and South America, and others are found, but
not abundantly, on most shores. The animal of the large <i>Lucupina
crenulata</i> from California is eight or ten inches in length, and almost
conceals the shell, and the shell of the South-African <i>Pupillæa aperta</i>
is also all but hidden beneath the mantle of the animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Pleurotomariæ</i> are extremely rare in recent times, only five
species being known, whereas over a thousand fossil forms have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>been described. The specimens of <i>P. adansoniana</i> and <i>P. beyrichi</i>
exhibited in case 9, are among the finest acquisitions to the shell
collection of recent years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 9–11.</div>

<p class='c007'>The “Ear-shells” or “Ormers” (<i>Haliotidæ</i>) are found adhering
to rocks in most parts of the world, with the exception of South
America. They are lined with <i>pearl</i>, and many exhibit splendid
colours and sculpture externally. Like the Limpets they hold on
to the rocks with such tenacity that it is absolutely impossible to
remove some of the larger species by force without injuring the
shell. Boiling water or mustard and water poured over them will,
however, soon compel them to relinquish their hold. The shell of
<i>Haliotis</i> is pierced by a series of holes parallel with the left margin.
Through such of them as are open the animal protrudes a slender
filament or feeler, and the water also finds its way through them
to the gills beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Single British species (<i>H. tuberculata</i>) is not actually found
on the English coast, but common on rocks and stones at low-water
in the Channel Islands. It is frequently eaten by the poor of those
islands and the north of France; other species in New Zealand,
China, Japan, West Africa, and elsewhere, constitute a common
article of diet among the natives. <i>Haliotis</i>-shells are largely used in
the manufacture of pearl ornaments, and in all kinds of inlaid work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Trochidæ</i>, and <i>Turbinidæ</i> are two extensive families, the

the operculum, which in the former is horny, and shelly in the
latter. The shells of these families are beautifully pearly within,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and the external shelly coat is generally brightly coloured and
highly ornamented. Several very pretty species are found on our

fresh water, and are less solid shells. The third section of <i>Neritidæ</i>,
the <i>Septariæ</i>, are shaped very much like Limpets, except that the
apex is at one end instead of central. They are, however, very
different animals, and furnished with a shelly operculum imbedded

<p class='c007'>The “Cowry-shells” (<i>Cypræidæ</i>) are remarkable for their varied

two flaps of the mantle, one on each side, which fold over the back,
a line down the centre of which usually marks where the flaps meet.
The animals are even more brilliantly coloured than the shells.
They have no operculum, but a large foot, which they can withdraw
entirely within their shell, although the aperture is usually very
narrow. Cowries, as is well known, are sold as ornaments; and a
small yellow species, “the money-cowry” (<i>C. moneta</i>), which is very
common in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, passes current as coin
among the negro tribes of certain parts of Africa. The specimen

by certain species of marine worms, <i>Serpula</i>, &#38;c.
They are free and spiral in early life, but afterwards
become distorted and generally attached to

to the kind of material chosen, have been named “Conchologists”
and “Mineralogists.” Beyond acting as a disguise, and consequently
as a protection, there does not appear to be any special utility in
thus adding to the weight of their own shells. The animals do not
glide like most other molluscs, but scramble along like the Strombs,
the form of their foot being small, divided into a front, expanded,

<p class='c007'>The “Helmet-shells” (<i>Cassididæ</i>) are used for cameo-carving;
they consist of differently coloured layers, so that the ground-colour

most artistic shell-cameos are produced in Italy, whence the art has
been introduced into France and England. The <i>Cassis madagascariensis</i>
(Fig. 12 on p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>) is in special request by shell-carvers on account
of the strong contrast of the white upper layer with the dark

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The family of <i>Muricidæ</i>, or “Rock-shells,” is another extensive
group, containing many very handsome and peculiar forms. The
animals of this family have a long proboscis, at the end of which
is the spiny tongue (radula), and which is retractile within the
body. The true Murices produce at intervals ribs or varices, which
in some species are ornamented with long spines or foliations, and
which indicate periods of growth, but of what duration we do not
know. They are all carnivorous, feeding chiefly on other Mollusca,
boring through the shells of bivalves with their spiny tongue,
and slowly devouring the unfortunate inhabitant piecemeal. From
certain species of <i>Murex</i> (<i>M. brandaris</i>, &#38;c.) found in the Mediterranean,
the ancients manufactured the celebrated Tyrian purple dye.</p>

remarkable habit of lengthening the aperture of its shell into an
elongate tube, in order to keep pace with the growth of the coral,
and to prevent its being overgrown and killed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 78–81.</div>

<p class='c007'>The “Volutes” (<i>Volutidæ</i>) are a group of shells also much
sought after by shell-collectors. Some of these attain to a very large
size, the animals inhabiting them being enormous. The Boat-shells
(<i>Cymba</i>) and Melons (<i>Cymbium</i>) are ovo-viviparous, the young
being carried about by the parent until they are an inch in length.
Volutes are found chiefly in the warmer parts of the Atlantic and
Indo-Pacific Oceans, and occur in the greatest variety on the coasts
of Australia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Olives (<i>Olividæ</i>) are common in most tropical seas, and are
remarkable for their beautiful polish and various patterns of colouring.

are said to have the power of swimming by expanding the lobes of
the foot.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Case 84.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Harps (<i>Harpidæ</i>) form a small well-marked group, of which

the west coast of Central America, and West Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next family, the “Slit-lips” (<i>Pleurotomatidæ</i>), consists of
very numerous species, over a thousand living forms having been

<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Tertiary strata have been described. The typical forms are characterized
by a slit in the outer side (lip) of the aperture. Species
of <i>Pleurotoma</i> are found in every sea, although most abundant in
the tropics, and, although so numerous in species, the number of
specimens is small in comparison with some other genera.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Auger-shells” (<i>Terebridæ</i>), like the Cones, present a great
similarity in form, but, unlike them, have a great diversity of “<i>sculpture</i>”
or external ornamentation. They are all elongate shells, with
a deep notch at the base of the aperture. Owing to the length and
comparative solidity of the shells, the animals of many of the species
do not carry their shelly structures on their backs, like most other
species, but drag them along the sandy sea-bottom.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>distinct kinds are known, is a great favourite with collectors on account
of the brilliant colours and various patterns of the shells. Some, owing
to their beauty and rarity, have been sold at very high prices, as
much as £50 having been paid for a single shell. The Cones are
found in all tropical seas, but are rare in cold or temperate latitudes.
None are met with on our own shores, one species alone being known
from the Mediterranean. They occur fossil in the Chalk and Tertiary
strata. These animals are all carnivorous, and live usually in
shallow water among rocks and coral-reefs. Some of them are said
to bite when handled, and to be dangerously poisonous, the bite in
some instances having been all but fatal.</p>

as families of aberrant Gastropods organised for swimming in the
open sea. The <i>Atlantas</i> are found in great numbers in warm latitudes,
and are provided with a glassy, thin, flat, spiral shell, not
unlike a keeled Ammonite. The glassy shell of the <i>Carinaria</i> is one
of the most beautiful structures of any mollusc, and at one time was
such a rarity that £100 are said to have been given for a single
specimen, which at the present time is perhaps worth only from five
to ten pounds. Species of <i>Carinaria</i> are found in the Mediterranean
and warmer parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The animal
is large, semitransparent, and elongate, with a compressed fin-like
foot which projects from the body, and is used in swimming. The
gills are placed towards the hinder part of the back and covered by
the shell. They feed on jelly-fish of various kinds, and probably on
other soft animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>True Snails (<i>Helicidæ</i>, etc.) have a distinct head furnished with
eyes, tentacles, cutting upper jaws, and rasping teeth, and all are
protected by a spiral shell. They are almost exclusively vegetable-feeders,
subsisting chiefly on leaves. The sexes are not distinct.
Many of the species are beautiful objects on account of the brilliancy
of their colouration, and some are remarkable for the variation they
exhibit in this respect. Species of <i>Helicidæ</i> are found in nearly
every part of the world and in all situations, from sea-level to an
altitude of 12,000 feet. They are fond of moisture, and in hot and
dry weather retire within their shells, remaining torpid until the
return of dew and rain. <i>Helix pomatia</i> (Case 119), which is found
on the chalk in the south of England and on the Continent, is
commonly eaten in Austria, France, and Belgium.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The eggs of Land-Snails vary in texture, size, and in numbers:
they are usually white, but in some instances yellow and pale green.
Those of some of the large South-American forms are as hard as
that of a hen, and more than an inch in length (Case 120).</p>

<p class='c007'>Slugs (Cases 106,107) are very like Snails without external shells;
most of them, however, possess a small internal shelly plate, or a few
calcareous granules hidden beneath the skin of the back. Some have
a large slime-pore at the end of the foot, and others are slightly
phosphorescent. Like the Snails, they are fond
of damp localities, and at times become great
pests to farmers in devouring the young shoots
of the growing corn. <i>Testacella</i>, which is found
in this country, differs from the Slugs in having
an external shell at the tail-end of the foot.
It is not slimy, and lives under ground, feeding
upon earthworms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Tooth-shells” (<i>Dentaliidæ</i>) form a
distinct group, the shells of which are very
unlike those of any other mollusc, but closely
resembling the shelly tubes constructed by
certain kinds of marine worms. The <i>Dentalia</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>have neither eyes nor tentacles, or a distinct head like Gastropods;
their organs of circulation and respiration are of a rudimentary
kind, and they have no heart. The sexes are separate. Their foot
is adapted for burrowing in sand, in which they live and obtain
their food, which consists of <i>Foraminifera</i> and minute Bivalves.
One species, <i>Dentalium pretiosum</i>, found on the shores of North-West
America, was until recently used as money by the Indians.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>Class IV.—LAMELLIBRANCHIA.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cases 137–204.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Molluscs belonging to this Class have neither head, nor
cephalic eyes, nor jaws or tongue like those of the other Classes, and
are enclosed in a shell which consists of two plates or valves held
together on one side of the margin by a horny, elastic substance,
called the “<i>ligament</i>.” Bivalves do not creep about in search of
food, but find their means of existence in the shape of minute
particles, both animal and vegetable, which happen to be contained
in the water which they breathe. Some, however, are capable of
locomotion by means of a well-developed foot, and a few swim
through the water by alternately opening and shutting their valves.
The body is enclosed within two lobes of the mantle which line the
interior of the valves, and which at their base are firmly attached to
the shell, producing on the shell a scar or impression called the
“pallial line.” The gills are lamellar or leaf-like, and placed on each
side of the body. Each gill is called a ctenidium, and consists of an
axis which is partly attached to the body of the Mollusc. This axis
generally gives off two plates consisting of hollow filaments which
are parallel with one another, directed downwards towards the
ventral side, and in most cases long and refolded upon themselves, so
that each plate becomes in reality a double lamella. In a few
instances, however, the filaments are simple and not reflected. They
are connected with one another by microscopic cilia, sometimes by
vascular junctions, and the dependent and reflected portions
(lamellæ) of each filament may be connected by “interlamellar
vascular junctions.” The mouth is merely an oval aperture at the
anterior end of the body, and generally furnished on each side with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>soft thin flaps, or labial palps, which have the function of conveying
the food to the mouth. The mantle secretes the substance out of
which the shell is formed. The two valves are always in contact at
the <i>hinge</i>, which is generally formed by small interlocking projections
or hinge-teeth, and they are closed by large adductor muscles, which
are attached to impressions in the interior of the shell. When these
muscles cease to act, as after death, the valves of the shell open in
consequence of the elasticity of the ligament on the dorsal margin.
The majority of species have two principal adductors, one at each end,
like the Venus-shells, Cockles, Razor-shells, &#38;c.; but in Oysters,
Scallops, and a few others, there is but a single central muscle. All
Bivalves are aquatic, and the majority marine. They are found
burrowing in sand or attached to rocks. Some perforate stones and
corals, others wood, and a few construct a sort of nest of fragments
of shells, stones, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many schemes of classification have from time to time been propounded,
based upon the presence or absence of respiratory siphons,
the number and position of the adductor shell-muscles, the character
of the shell-hinge, &#38;c. The most recent arrangement is founded
principally upon the structure of the gills. The value of such a
classification has yet to be fully tested. Mr. Paul Pilseneer has
suggested five orders of Lamellibranchs: Protobranchia, Filibranchia,
Pseudolamellibranchia, Eulamellibranchia, Septibranchia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this order the filaments of the gills are not reflected, but
arranged in two divergent rows, the foot being expanded and
flattened beneath with crenulated margins and with the byssal gland
very slightly developed. The <i>Nuculidæ</i> and <i>Solenomyidæ</i> are the
only families belonging to this order. The shells of the former are
remarkable for the numerous fine interlocking hinge-teeth, and those
of the latter on account of the strong fringed periostracum.</p>

The foot is usually provided with a well-developed byssal gland.
<i>Anomia</i>, <i>Arca</i>, <i>Trigonia</i>, and <i>Mytilus</i> belong to this order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 137–138.</div>

<p class='c007'>The family of <i>Anomiidæ</i> contains a number of more or less pearly
shells remarkable for a deep notch or hole in the lower or flat valve
through which a shelly plug passes, by means of which the animal
attaches itself to other shells, stones, &#38;c. <i>Anomia ænigmatica</i> is
found adhering to leaves in mangrove-swamps.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Case 138.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Placunidæ</i>, sometimes called Window-shells and Saddle-Oysters,
are very flat pearly shells with a remarkable hinge, which
consists of two long divergent teeth, like a <span class='large'><b>⋀</b></span>, to which the ligament
is attached. The species are few in number, and inhabit sandy
shores of India, China, and North Australia.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 139–141.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Arcidæ</i> are a family of strong ponderous shells varying much
in form and sculpture. The animals have a longish pointed foot,
deeply grooved along the bottom, no labial palpi, and free margins
to the mantle, which are not prolonged into breathing-siphons.
Many of the Arks often anchor themselves by means of a strong
byssus. The shells of this family are usually radiately ridged; and
the hinge is composed of a number of teeth arranged along the
hinge-line, which is generally straight. <i>Arca tortuosa</i>, from China,
has the valves curiously twisted. The section <i>Barbatia</i> is remarkable
for the coarse fibrous character of the epidermis; <i>Scapharca</i> for
its unequal valves; and <i>Cucullæa</i>, from the Indian Ocean, for the
elevated ridge bounding the posterior muscular impression. <i>Glycymeris</i>
(better known as <i>Pectunculus</i>) has the hinge-teeth arranged in
an arched series, and the shells are more regular in growth than in
many other forms of <i>Arcidæ</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Case 141.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Trigoniidæ</i> are one of those families which have all but
disappeared during our period. Only three or four living species are
known, whilst more than a hundred fossil forms have been described
from the Jurassic and Cretaceous formations. Australia, where
some of the oldest types of animal life persist, furnishes also the
existing species of <i>Trigonia</i> (Fig. 27). The animals have a long,
sharply-bent, pointed foot like the Cockles, with which they make
surprising leaps. The shells are beautifully pearly within, and
ribbed and noduled exteriorly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Mytilidæ</i>, or Mussels, are too well known to need description.
The small foot, which is brown in the common species, is
not much used in creeping about, but has
the power of spinning a byssus or bundle
of tough threads, by means of which the
animals attach themselves to rocks and one
another, forming colonies of vast numbers.
Mussels have always been much eaten in
this and other maritime countries, and large
quantities are brought to the London market
from the Dutch coast. At times they are
unwholesome; but all the exact causes of
this are not known. Mussels seem to be
found on every shore, and some of the
species are very widely distributed—the
common edible Mussel, <i>M. edulis</i>, being found on every European
coast, on the shores of North and South America, in the Arctic
and Antarctic Oceans, and probably on the coasts of Australia.</p>

<p class='c007'>One group of Mussels (<i>Lithodomus</i>, Case 144) burrow in rocks and
other shells, forming holes just large enough to contain their shells.
<i>L. dactylus</i> is sold as an article of diet on the shores of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cases 145–160.</div>

<p class='c007'>The gills in this order are plicate, and the two lamellæ of each
plate are furnished with conjunctive or vascular interlamellar junctions,
and the filaments are connected by interfilamentar ciliated discs
in some cases, in others by vascular concrescence. The mantle-margins
are separated all round, and the foot is either small or
wanting. Only a single adductor muscle is generally present. The
Pearl-oysters, true Oysters, and Scallops are the forms which constitute
this order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large family of <i>Aviculidæ</i> includes the “Wing-shells”
(<i>Avicula</i>), the “Pearl” and “Hammer Oysters” (<i>Meleagrina</i> and
<i>Malleus</i>), and <i>Pinna</i> (Fig. 28). Some species of <i>Pinna</i> attain to a
length of two feet. They are found imbedded in the sand with the
narrow pointed end downwards. They form a large silky byssus,
which can be woven or knitted into gloves, socks, etc. (see side table—case
B). The “Hammer-Oyster” (<i>Malleus</i>) is so called from its rude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>resemblance to a hammer. The “Pearl-Oysters” (<i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i>,
Fig. 29) possess rather heavy strong shells, lined with very
thick layers of “mother-o’-pearl.” Hundreds of tons of these shells
are annually collected at the great pearl-fisheries of North and West
Australia, and imported into Europe. The pearl-oyster of Ceylon
(<i>M. fucata</i>, Case 146) is a smaller species, and collected more for the
pearls than the shells. The round pearls, which are valued so highly,
are either excrescences of the pearly layer or are found loose in the
fleshy parts of the animal. Some small foreign body which has accidentally
penetrated under the mantle and irritates the animal is
covered with successive concentric layers of nacre, thus attaining
sometimes, but rarely, the size of a small filbert. The nacre is
generally of the well-known pearly-white colour, very rarely dark,
and occasionally almost black. The action of the animal in secreting
successive layers of nacre over any foreign body which intrudes
between the mantle-folds, and thus converting it into a pearl, is
strikingly illustrated by two specimens in which, in the one case, an
entire fish, and in the other a small crab, have been so enclosed
(see side table-case E).</p>

<p class='c007'>The most ancient and, even at the present day, one of the most
important of the pearl-fisheries is that carried on on the western
shores of Ceylon. “The Banks,” or spots on which the oysters
grow, are at an average depth of 30 to 60 feet, and extend several
miles along the coast. The oysters, which should be six or seven
years old when collected, are gathered in baskets by native divers
and hauled up by ropes into hundreds of small boats. The shells
are then brought to land and placed upon the ground to die and
putrefy, and then minutely examined for the pearls, which are either
found loose in the shells or imbedded in the fleshy parts of the
oysters. As many as two million oysters have been brought ashore
on one day; but the number obtained varies very much according
to the state of the banks. A small proportion of the oysters
contain pearls; in some only very small ones (seed or dust-pearls
as they are called) are found, and very few contain pearls larger
than a pea, which are so highly valued. In his account of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>pearl-fishery of Ceylon the Rev. James Cordiner says that he saw
the operation of sorting the pearls performed; the produce of
17,000 oysters weighed only ¾ lb. and was contained in a vessel
smaller than a common soup-plate. Out of that quantity there
were not found two fine perfect pearls; all of the largest were
slightly deformed, rugged and uneven, but of the smaller sizes
many were round and perfect. The chief qualities which regulate
the value of pearls are size, roundness, and brilliancy of lustre. Of
the smallest kind several may be bought for a shilling, whilst many
thousand pounds have been given for a single fine pearl of surpassing
beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other important pearl-fisheries besides that of Ceylon are carried
on in the Persian Gulf, on the west coast of Central America, and
especially North-west Australia, where diving-dresses are now
employed in collecting the shells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chinese obtain pearls artificially from a species of freshwater
Mussel (<i>Dipsas plicata</i>). In order to do this they keep them
in tanks and insert between the shell and the animal either small
shot or small round pieces of mother-of-pearl, which soon receive
regular coatings of nacre and assume the look of ordinary pearls.
They also insert small metal images of Buddha, which also soon
become covered with pearl and firmly cemented to the shell, the
production being to the uninitiated a supernatural testimony to the
truth of Buddhism. (A shell treated in this way is exhibited in one
of the small cases (E) at the side of the room.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 152–154.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Ostreidæ</i>, or Oysters, undoubtedly take the first rank among
molluscs as regards usefulness to mankind as an article of food.
They have no foot; the mantle is entirely open, with double edges,
each being bordered by a short fringe, and the labial palps are large
and somewhat triangular. There are on each side a pair of simple
gills, which appear closely striated; the single adductor muscle is
large and nearly central (see Fig. 30). The Oyster is, except in the
very young state, entirely incapable of locomotion, and always
attached by the deeper valve to other shells, rocks, or other substances.
The common British species is not full-grown until it is
about five or seven years old. A series of different ages, from the
“spat” to the adult form, is exhibited in Case 152. During the
months of May, June, and July the eggs are discharged into
the gills, where they remain until hatched; and it is during
this period that oysters are “out of season.” In the American
Oyster (<i>O. virginica</i>), on the contrary, the eggs are said to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>hatched outside the parent shell. Oysters of different kinds are
found on nearly every shore. The gigantic <i>O. gigas</i> is said to
grow to the length of three feet in the Bay of Taichou, Japan,
where it is commonly eaten. About two hundred fossil species have
already been described.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 154–156.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Spondylidæ</i>, or Thorny Oysters, closely resemble the Scallops,
but the shells are more spiny, heavier, united by interlocking teeth,
and one of the valves is attached to rocks, corals, etc. Many of the
species are very brightly coloured; and from the fact that small
quantities of water are sometimes enclosed in cavities in the inner
layer of the shell, they have been called “Water-Clams” or “Water
Spondyli.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Limas (<i>Limidæ</i>) are very like the Pectens, but the inner
edge of their mantle is fringed with very long thread-like filaments.
The shells are always white, generally more or less oblique, and
radiately ridged. They appear to be found in most seas, and either
swim about freely like the young Scallops by flapping their valves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>or attach themselves by a byssus, sometimes forming a sort of nest,
consisting of pieces of coral and shell or small stones, in which they

<p class='c007'>The Scallops or Fan-shells (<i>Pectinidæ</i>) are well known for their
beautiful colours, sculpture, and excellent flavour. The animal has
a distinct foot, which is not, however, used as a locomotive organ,
but employed in spinning a byssus of attachment when required.
The young Pectens dart through the water by opening and suddenly
closing their valves. The species are very numerous, world-wide in
their distribution, and may be found at depths from a few to <i>three
thousand</i> fathoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this order the gills have interfilamentar and interlamellar

The order is very extensive, comprising nearly sixty families, of
which only the more important can be referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Carditidæ</i> and <i>Astartidæ</i> have strong solid shells, frequently
ornamented with radiating or concentric ribbing, and usually are
coated with a dark epidermis. They have the general appearance
of certain <i>Veneridæ</i>; but the animal has no prolonged siphons, but
merely a fringed opening in the mantle. One very remarkable
species, <i>Thecalia concamerata</i> (Case 161), has an internal cup-like
process within the valves, which serves as a nursing-pouch for the
young.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 162–163.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Lucinidæ</i> are almost invariably white shells, and may
generally be recognized by the very long muscular scar in front
on the inner surface of the valves. They occur in all parts of the
world; and the fossil forms, which are still more numerous than
those now living, have existed at every epoch from the Silurian.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 166–177.</div>

<p class='c007'>Of the freshwater Mussels or <i>Unionidæ</i> more than 1200 species
have been already discovered; they are found in most parts of the
world, the greatest number having been described from North
America. In <i>Unio</i> the edges of the mantle are not united along
the bottom and not prolonged into siphonal tubes; at the posterior
end there are two openings, of which the upper or excretal orifice
is simple, and the lower or branchial fringed at the edge. Two
“cephalic eyes” have recently been noticed by Mr. P. Pelseneer.
The foot is very large and adapted for crawling and burrowing.
The sexes are distinct; and the shells of the females are somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>more tumid than those of the males. <i>Margaritana margaritifera</i>,
(Case 168) which is found in this country and in Europe, sometimes
produces handsome pearls, but not equal to those obtained from the
pearl-oyster of tropical seas. The hinge in this family is extremely
variable, being in some instances delicate and toothless (<i>Anodonta</i>,

with strong interlocking teeth (see Fig. 31, A).</p>

<p class='c007'>The family <i>Ætheriidæ</i>, or freshwater Oysters, consists of but
three genera: <i>Ætheria</i> contains African, and <i>Mülleria</i> and <i>Barttettia</i>
Indian and South-American forms. When young the shells of
<i>Ætheria</i> (which are common in the Nile) are free and not unlike
an <i>Anodonta</i>, but when adult they become attached and irregular
and look like an olive-green Oyster; they are, however, provided
with two muscular impressions instead of one, as in ordinary marine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Oysters. Still more remarkable is <i>Mülleria lobata</i> of Colombia, which,
when young, freely moves about and has two adductor muscles, but
in time becomes attached and stationary, and then possesses but a
single adductor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 179–181.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Tellinas</i> have usually thin shells, and their two siphons are
longer and more completely separated from each other than in the
<i>Veneridæ</i>. The pallial line is widely and deeply sinuated, and the
ligament generally external. In the genus <i>Semele</i> of the family
<i>Scrobiculariidæ</i>, it is placed within the hinge-margin. They live
in great numbers beneath the sand in shallow water, and are
occasionally used as food.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 183–185.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Mactridæ</i> have an internal ligament to the hinge, the
siphons are joined together and fringed at the ends, and the pallial
line is more or less sinuated. <i>Spisula solidissima</i> (Case 184), the
largest species found on the coast of the United States, is a common
article of diet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next family, <i>Veneridæ</i>, have long respiratory siphons and
a sinuated pallial line. Many of this tribe are very beautiful in
form and colouring, and most of them have very hard strong shells.
The valves are united above by an external ligament, and the hinge-plate
is toothed. Nearly all of them live buried an inch or two
beneath the sand or mud, but a few are
found burrowing in rocks. Probably the
majority of the species of this family
might be used as food. <i>Venus verrucosa</i>,
of our own southern shores, is frequently
eaten both in this country and abroad; and
<i>Venus mercenaria</i> (Case 189) is commonly
sold in the markets of Philadelphia and
New York. <i>Cytherea lusoria</i> (Case 185)
also forms a favourite article of diet among
the poorer classes in Japan, and several
kinds are eaten by the natives of New
Zealand and other countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the “Cockles” (<i>Cardiidæ</i>)
from warm latitudes are highly coloured

Probably the majority are eatable, as
the common cockle (<i>Cardium edule</i>) of the
British coast. The foot of these molluscs is very large, bent, and
used for leaping. The siphons are short and fringed at the margins.</p>

united mantle-margins in having but a central adductor muscle.
In the typical species the animal is attached to the rocks by a
“byssus,” a strong fibrous structure which passes through an
aperture at the upper part of the shell. A species found in the
Red Sea, <i>T. elongata</i>, is eaten by the natives, and the shell employed
for the manufacture of lime. <i>Tridacna gigas</i>, the largest known
bivalved mollusc, sometimes weighs over 500 lb., that exhibited in
the upright cases at the entrance of the Gallery being 310 lb. in
weight. A large pair bordered with gilt copper are used as <i>bénitiers</i>
or holy-water vessels in the church of St. Sulpice in Paris. <i>Tridacnæ</i>
are found associated in large numbers in lagoons, among coral-reefs
in the Eastern and Pacific Seas. The animals are described as presenting
a beautiful iridescent glare of blue, violet, and yellow
variegated with fantastic markings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The genus <i>Chama</i> consists of tropical species, which are found
fixed to corals, rocks, etc. Nevertheless, they have a small bent foot,
but what purpose it serves is difficult to conceive.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this place attention should be called to the <i>Hippuritidæ</i> and
<i>Radiolitidæ</i>, very remarkable extinct families of bivalved molluscs
which occur abundantly in the cretaceous strata of southern and
eastern Europe, Egypt, etc. They are remarkable for the solidity
of the shells, the relatively small space occupied by the animal, and
the complicated character of the hinge and processes bearing the
adductor muscles. They are usually classed near to the <i>Chamidæ</i>,
but their true position as regards living Mollusca is very problematical.

<p class='c007'>The <i>Myidæ</i>, popularly known as “<i>Gapers</i>,” on account of their
valves being open at one or both ends, have the mantle united all
round, except where the small foot is protruded. The siphons are
very long, united almost to the ends, and covered with a coarse
wrinkled outer skin. They bury themselves in mud and sand at low-water
mark or in shallow water. The species are few in number, and
chiefly from the shores of northern countries. <i>Mya arenaria</i> of our
own coasts is largely eaten in some parts of Europe and North America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the <i>Solenidæ</i>, or Razor-shells, possess very elongated
shells, and are remarkable for the great development of the foot,
which can be pointed or contracted as may be required for boring
into sand. By means of this powerful foot the animals, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>disturbed, bore with such rapidity and to such a depth that their
capture is a matter of great difficulty; and even when seized they
hold on so tightly that at times they suffer their foot to be torn off
rather than be captured. They not only burrow in sand, but also
have the power of darting through the water, like the Scallops.
Solens were considered a dainty dish by the ancient Greeks, and
numbers are still eaten by the poorer coast-population of this
country and abroad.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases 201–202.</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Pholadidæ</i>, or Piddocks, are very remarkable shells, of an
unusually complicated structure, some having the power of boring
into rocks, wood, mud, sand, etc. Their shells are white, adorned
with prickly sculpture, and, although thin, are strong. The foot is
believed to be the principal excavating instrument, but the shell no
doubt is used as a file to enlarge the hole as the creature grows.
These animals are brightly phosphorescent; and certain species are
eaten at many places on the shores of the Mediterranean. They
appear to be indifferent as regards the material they bore into; for
the common <i>Pholas dactylus</i> (Fig. 36) of our own shores has been
found in slate-rocks, mica-schist, coal-shale, new red sandstone,
chalk, marl, peat, and submarine wood. The siphons are long in the
Piddocks, united except near the end, and enclosed in tough skin.
The species are world-wide in their distribution, and several are
found fossil in some of the Tertiary formations.</p>

but do not perforate rocks. They are principally wood-borers; the
large <i>Kuphus arenaria</i>, which is an exception, living buried in the
sand. The ship-worm has a long worm-like body, from 6 to 12
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>inches in length, which is more or less enclosed in a thin shelly tube
or sheath. The true bivalved shell is at the thicker end, and protects
the mouth, labial palps, the liver, and
other internal organs. At the opposite, or
more slender, end of the animal, the mantle
is produced into two small tubes, one of which
conveys the water to the gills, whilst through
the other the water is expelled, charged with
the woody pulp excavated by the foot. At
the end there is a pair of pallets, or paddles
as they are sometimes
termed, which are probably
used as a means of defence,
in closing the shelly tube
after the contraction of the
siphons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Watering-pot
shell” (<i>Brechites</i>), of the
family <i>Clavagellidæ</i>, is a
very remarkable structure,
and unlike the shell of an
ordinary bivalved mollusc.
On looking carefully, however, near the perforated

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cases 205–208.</div>

<p class='c007'>This Class includes the Octopus or Polypus, Cuttlefish, Squid,
Spirula, the Paper and Pearly Nautilus. The body of the animal consists
of a muscular sac, in the cavity of which the viscera are placed.
In front of the body projects the head, which, in species belonging to
the two-gilled section of the Class, is surrounded by eight or ten fleshy
arms. A wide aperture below the head admits the water to the gills
or branchiæ, which are situated in the interior of the sac, whilst a
short tube, the so-called funnel or siphuncle, projects from the opening
of the mantle—the water and various excretions being expelled
through this tube, especially also an ink-like fluid, which is discharged
by all Cephalopods (except <i>Nautilus</i>) when disturbed, in
order to darken the water and thus escape their enemies. The
centre of the head, between the base of the arms, is occupied by the
mouth, which is armed with two horny or calcareous jaws, similar
to the beak of a parrot (Fig. 39). The two large eyes are placed on
the sides of the head. The arms or feet are more or less elongate,
capable of movement in any direction, and, except in <i>Nautilus</i>,
furnished on one side with numerous suckers, by means of which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>animal attaches itself most securely to anything it may seize; they
are employed in capturing food and in walking. Cephalopods walk
in any direction head downwards, but can swim backwards only,
being propelled in that direction by the water which they discharge
with force through the funnel out of their branchial cavity. They
are divided, according to the number of their gills (which is either
two or four), into <i>Dibranchia</i> and <i>Tetrabranchia</i>.
Of the latter but one representative
now exists, viz., the Pearly Nautilus, all
other living Cephalopods being provided with
but two gills, placed one on each side of the
body within the mantle, as may be seen in the
wax model of <i>Sepia officinalis</i> (Case 207). The
two-gilled section comprises forms with eight
arms, as <i>Argonauta</i> and <i>Octopus</i>, and others
with ten arms, viz., the Cuttlefishes (<i>Sepia</i>)
(Fig. 43), the Squids (<i>Loligo</i>, <i>Ommatostrephes</i>,
<i>Sepiola</i>, <i>Chiroteuthis</i>, etc.), and <i>Spirula</i>. The
“shell” of the Paper-Nautilus, or <i>Argonauta</i>,
is too well known to require any description.
Unlike the shells of other Mollusca, it is not attached to the animal
by a special muscle, but is held on to the body by two of the arms,
which are dilated and specially adapted for this purpose. Only the
female Argonaut is provided with a shell, the male being shellless
and a much smaller creature. The Argonaut-shell is therefore
not a true shell, but simply a receptacle for the ova, serving at the
same time for the protection of the parent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The species of Octopus are found on the shores of almost all temperate
and tropical seas; they do not attain to a large size, and are
without the internal shell or “bone” which is found in the mantle
of many Cephalopods. That of the Cuttlefish or <i>Sepia</i> (Fig. 43 <i>a</i>) is
found in abundance on our coasts; it is composed of numberless
layers of a friable calcareous substance. That of the Squid tribe is
of quite another character, consisting of an elongate thin horny
plate, and strengthened by one or more thickened ribs, in some
species somewhat resembling a quill-pen. Some species of this pen-bearing
class related to the Common Squid attain an immense size.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>One was captured off the Irish coast in June, 1875 (probably <i>Architeuthis
harveyi</i>), with the shorter arms 8 feet in length and 15 inches
in circumference at the base, the two tentacular arms having a total
length of 30 feet. The powerful beak measured about 4 inches
across. Thus from the tip of the tail to the end of the tentacular
arms this wonderful monster must have measured something like 40
feet in length. Other very large specimens of <i>Architeuthis</i> have
been captured on the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador. Two
specimens stranded on the south coast of Newfoundland, in the winter
of 1870–1871, measured respectively 40 and 47 feet. Another, cast
ashore at Bonavista Bay in December, 1873, had a very stout body
14 feet long, arms 10 feet, and tentacles 24 feet in length. These
are only a few of the many instances of the capture of gigantic
Cephalopods, which occur not only in the North-Atlantic Ocean, but
also in tropical seas. Their appearance in mid-ocean may, in some
instances, have given rise to the tales of “Sea-serpents.” Specimens
much smaller than those mentioned above have attacked men, and
pearl-fishers are in constant fear of them. One of the arms of a
large Squid (<i>Architeuthis harveyi?</i>), which is supposed to have been
found off the coast of South America, is exhibited in the black
upright Case A at the side of the room.</p>

which consists chiefly of small crabs or Mollusca, which it crushes
with its strong calcareous parrot-like mandibles.</p>

supposed that many of the specimens exhibited therein were seaweeds;
but a closer inspection, especially with a lens, will reveal
structure of a kind not to be found in any plant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us select for examination <i>Flustra foliacea</i>, the Broad-leaved
Hornwrack or Sea-Mat (Fig. 1), (Case A 1), commonly to be found
among heaps of seaweed cast up on sandy shores round our
coasts.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The brown horny fronds, which vary in width, branch upwards
from a narrow flat stem attached at its base to stones and shells.
Both surfaces of the fronds show a fine network pattern formed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the edges of little oblong boxes or cells termed zoœcia,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> arranged in
longitudinal parallel rows and forming a double layer back to back.
The cells are broad and rounded above, narrow and truncate below,
and each is roofed in by a transparent membrane with a semicircular
lid or operculum situated near the upper end; four short stout
spines spring from the margin in this neighbourhood. When the
surface of a living frond is examined in sea-water, here and there
a bundle of tentacles may be observed pushing up a lid, slowly
emerging and expanding into a bell-shaped coronet; on the least
alarm the tentacles are rapidly withdrawn into the cell and the lid
shut. The flexible protrusible region of the cell is termed the
tentacle sheath. The relation of the cell to the tentacle sheath
(Figs. 2, 3) may be roughly compared to a glove finger, stiff below,
but flexible at the end, and surmounted by a crown of bristles; on
pulling down the glove-finger tip, the tentacles will also be drawn
in, and will lie in a sheath formed by the invaginated portion of
glove finger. The lid which closes over the tentacle sheath is only
found in the Sub-order Chilostomata to which <i>Flustra</i> belongs. The
area of the tentacle sheath whence the tentacles arise is termed the
lophophore.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The mouth is situated in the centre of the lophophore, surrounded
by the circle of tentacles; and the latter, by the action of their cilia,
set up currents which convey food to the mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mouth leads into a pharynx and gullet, the latter opening
into a stomach, whence the intestine ascends to terminate in the
vent opening below and outside the circle of tentacles; the intestines,
in fact, form a U-shaped tube (Figs. 4, 5) suspended in
the body-cavity in the interior of the cell. A cord, the funiculus,
passes from the stomach to the base of the body-cavity. A small
nerve ganglion is situated within the upper part of the loop of
intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tentacles, intestines, and other organs constitute the “polypide,”
the cell being simply the protective house formed by the
latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body-cavity, which contains fluid, is in direct communication
with the interior of the tentacles, which are hollow, and which act
as respiratory organs by bringing the fluids of the body-cavity in
proximity to the water. In <i>Flustra</i> the body-cavities of the cells
are shut off from each other, but pores and sieves in the partition
walls allow of the junction of the inner linings of these cavities.
The male and female reproductive elements are formed in the body-cavity.
The egg develops in a helmet-shaped brood-pouch, the
ovicell, situated at the summit of the cell and almost immersed in
the cell above. The ciliated embryo swims about for a few hours
and settles down to form the first polypide and cell; from the
latter there arise buds which remain attached, and produce other
buds, till a colony like that of <i>Flustra</i> results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the ordinary cells are certain smaller cells (Fig. 1, <i>a</i>)
slightly raised above the general level, different in shape from the
ordinary kind and with thicker lids. These peculiar cells are termed
avicularia, and chiefly contain muscles for opening and shutting the
lid. They arise by modification of the ordinary cells, whereby all
the organs of the polypide have become atrophied except the muscles.
The Polyzoa<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> were so named by Vaughan Thompson, who, in 1820,
discovered that certain plant-like animals, which had previously been
classed with the zoophytes, possessed a much higher organisation,
in that the intestine was separate from the body-cavity and not continuous
with it as in Sea-Firs, Sea-Anemones, and Corals. In 1834,
Ehrenberg named the group Bryozoa<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> or Moss Animals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>With the exception of one genus (<i>Loxosoma</i>), all Polyzoa form
colonies, which arise by the continual budding of the cells, the buds
remaining attached to the parent cells. The colonies vary endlessly
in form and habit, occurring as crusts on rocks, etc., masses, broad
fronds, branching tree-like growths, bushy tufts, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The texture and consistency may be gelatinous, cartilaginous,
horny and flexible, or stony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great majority of species are marine, but a considerable
number inhabit fresh water. The Polyzoa are classified as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Section A.</i> <span class='sc'>Cellularina.</span>—<i>Bugula turbinata</i>, or the Bird’s-head
Coralline (Fig. 6) grows attached to rocks near low water mark in
the form of spiral tufts about two inches in height, composed of
narrow flat branches in which the cells are arranged from two to six
abreast and all facing upwards. Each cell is boat-shaped and with
nearly the whole front surface membranous; the globular bodies at
the head of certain cells are the ovicells. Attached to the outer edge
of each cell is a remarkable object resembling a bird’s head, and
hence termed avicularium, seated on a short stalk. The head and
beak contain powerful muscles for opening and shutting a horny lid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>or mandible hinged on below. In life, the avicularium sways to and
fro on its stalk, with the lower “jaw” continually snapping up and
down in the most ludicrous fashion. The beak is capable of seizing
and holding quite large objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The function of these curious appendages is partly to warn off
trespassers and partly to capture and retain small animals till decomposition
has set in; in the latter case, the currents set up by
the tentacles draw in the particles to the mouths of the polypides.
The avicularia have arisen by modification of the ordinary
cells, in which the muscles have developed at the expense of the
degenerated polypides, the cells have become much smaller, of
different shape, and separated out from the rest; the mandible
represents the lid or operculum of the ordinary cell. The avicularia
vary greatly in size and shape in the different genera; in
<i>Flustra</i>, for instance, these organs closely resemble the ordinary cells.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>(Fig. 8), one of the treasures of the “Challenger” Expedition, was
dredged from 1525 fathoms off Cape St. Vincent. The stem, which
tapers gradually upwards, rises from a tuft of root fibres. The cup
is formed of slender branches supported at the base by a delicate
membrane. The branches are composed of biserial rows of cells
(Fig. 9) opening towards the interior of the cup. The avicularia are
pear-shaped and pedunclate. Probably, in life, the cup is capable of
being opened out to a considerable extent. Specimens of this species

are composed of cells arranged in a double row. Each cell has the
membranous area of its front surface protected by a branched flattened
spine or operculum, and is produced and narrowed below; at the
upper outer margin is a minute triangular avicularium. At the base
of the back surface is a small sack-shaped cell with a cleft at the
upper end, in which a horny bristle is articulated. The little cell
is termed a vibracular cell, and the bristle a vibraculum.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> This
organ has arisen by a further modification of an avicularium, whereby

by their motion keep off intruders, and possibly act as scavengers by
sweeping the surface of the cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The polypides are borne on contractile stalks. In the <i>Pedicellinidæ</i>
the stalks arise from a creeping stolon. In <i>Pedicellina cernua</i>(*)
(Fig. 24) a stolon, creeping over seaweeds, etc., gives rise to stalked
cups, the movements of which are vigorous: “the polypides, when
excited, dash themselves vehemently from side to side. The heads
are easily knocked off, but the decapitated stalks develop fresh ones.
In <i>Ascopodaria</i> the stalks are swollen at the base; <i>A. fruticosa</i>(*), from
Port Phillip, Victoria, forms beautiful tree-like colonies. The
<i>Loxosomidæ</i> do not form colonies, owing to the buds becoming
detached from the parent. The species of <i>Loxosoma</i> are always found
associated with some other animal, such as a worm or Tunicate.
The tentacles of the polypide are arranged obliquely to the long
axis of the body, hence the name of the family (<i>loxos</i>, oblique).
<i>Loxosoma phascolosomatum</i>(*) occurs, in the form of delicate tufts, on
the caudal end of the Sipunculid worm <i>Phascolosoma</i>. The individuals
resemble pins with little white heads, and are capable of vigorous
movements to and fro; occasionally a stalk coils itself up into a
spiral.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Small Table Case A against the west wall to left of main entrance.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Brachiopoda, though presenting a certain outward resemblance
to bivalved Mollusca, are quite distinct from this group. They are
all marine, and all possess a bivalve shell. They grow attached to
rocks (Fig. 1), usually by a horny peduncle or stalk passing between
the two valves, or through a foramen in one of the latter; or,
peduncle and foramen may be absent, one of the valves adhering by
its surface to the rocks; some species of <i>Lingula</i> live in tubes in the
sand or mud. They occur at all depths, from shallow water up to
2900 fathoms, but the largest number of species live at a depth of
about 350 fathoms. Though found in all seas, the localities whence
they have been obtained are comparatively few in number; but
specimens are usually congregated in considerable numbers, in places
where they do occur. The surviving species of Brachiopods constitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>only a small remnant of a group that flourished abundantly
in former epochs. There are about 150 recent, and over 6000
fossil species.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Shell.</span>—The valves of a Brachiopod shell differ from each
other in size and shape, but each valve is in itself symmetrical, <i>i.e.</i>,
similar on each side of a middle line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The valve through which the peduncle passes is termed the
<i>peduncle</i> or <i>ventral valve</i> (Fig. 2, A), the other being the <i>brachial</i> or
<i>dorsal valve</i>. The peduncle valve, which is usually the larger and
uppermost, contains the bulk of the viscera; in the higher genera,
calcareous bars or loops (Fig. 2, B) attached to the inner surface of
the brachial valve form a support for the “arms” of the animal.
The inner surface of the valves presents certain markings and
depressions where the muscles have been attached (Fig. 6).</p>

Brachial valve, showing the reflected loop for support of the “arms.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The shell is constructed of very minute prisms of calcareous
substance imbedded in an organic matrix. In <i>Lingula</i> the shell is
formed of alternating layers of horny and calcareous substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shell-valves are either hingeless, or joined by a hinge in
which teeth in the peduncle valve fit into sockets in the brachial
valve. The Brachiopoda are primarily divided into two sections,
<i>Inarticulata</i> and <i>Articulata</i>, based on the absence or presence of a
hinge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The division into Orders is based on the relation of the peduncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to the valves in its passage between them or through one of them.
In the most primitive Brachiopoda (<i>Lingulidæ</i>), the peduncle
simply passes out between the valves and not through a foramen or
pore in one of them; hence the group is named <i>Atremata</i> (<i>a</i>, not,
<i>trema</i>, pore). In the next group, including the families <i>Discinidæ</i>
and <i>Craniidæ</i>, the peduncle passes through a fissure in the edge of
the peduncle valve, the fissure in recent forms becoming closed round
to form a slit-like foramen; this group is named <span class='sc'>Neotremata</span> (<i>neos</i>,
new, <i>trema</i>, pore). In the third group, <span class='sc'>Protremata</span> (<i>pro</i>, in front
of, <i>trema</i>, pore), which includes the <i>Thecidiidæ</i>, the peduncle lies at
the apex of a triangular fissure in the peduncle valve, and secretes a
calcareous plate to fill in the gap. In the fourth group, <span class='sc'>Telotremata</span>
(<i>telos</i>, final or complete, <i>trema</i>, pore), including the <i>Terebratulidæ</i>,
etc., the triangular fissure in the peduncle valve is filled
in by two calcareous plates termed deltidia, secreted by the edges of
the mantle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The valves are hingeless in the first two Orders (Inarticulata),
and hinged in the last two (Articulata).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Body.</span>—The body usually occupies only a comparatively
small space in the posterior or peduncle end of the shell. From
each side of the body there is given off a thin expansion, the mantle
which lines the inner surface of the shell. The space between the
valves is termed the mantle-cavity. The mouth is situated in the
centre of the front wall of the body or floor of the mantle-cavity.
The front wall gives rise to a horseshoe-shaped platform surrounding
the mouth and bearing on its upper edge ciliated tentacles, or cirri,
which set up currents carrying food towards the mouth. In many
genera the platform is produced into two coiled “arms” (Figs. 3
and 5), which fill up the mantle-cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The name Brachiopoda (<i>brachion</i>, arm, <i>pous</i>, foot) was given to
the group because these “arms” were supposed to be homologous
with the Molluscan “foot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mouth leads into a gullet, which opens into a stomach and
intestine. In the more primitive forms the intestine terminates in
a vent, but in the higher forms the distal end of the intestine has
become atrophied, and consequently the gut ends blindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body-cavity contains fluid, and is in communication with a
system of sinuses in the lobes of the mantle (Fig. 5). Bands of
muscles pass across from valve to valve. The peduncle consists of
a horny outer sheath surrounding longitudinal and transverse bands
of muscles.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The sexes are usually separate. The reproductive cells are
formed in the body-cavity. The embryo swims freely for a short
time before settling down and becoming fixed. The specimens
exhibited in the case are arranged according to the following

emerald green or golden brown duck-bill-shaped shells. Having no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>hinge, the dead valves of dried shells easily fall apart. The peduncle,
which is sometimes over six inches in length, passes between the
pointed posterior borders of the valves. Dr.
François gives a very interesting account of
the habits of <i>Lingula anatina</i> which he found
living in the sand at Noumea, New Hebrides.
The sole evidence of the animal’s existence
is the presence, on the surface of the sand
or mud, of a small, three-lobed slit (Fig. 4,
upper figure). The tube (Fig. 4) in which
the <i>Lingula</i> lives is about four inches deep,
flat in the upper half, rounded below. The
walls of the upper flat portion simply consist
of the sand with a surface coating of
mucous secretion; but in the lower end the
sand grains are agglutinated so as to form a
distinct tube.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The edges of the mantle-folds are provided
with setæ (bristles), which form three
funnels protruding through the three lobes
of the slit-like mouth of the sand-tube;
currents enter by the lateral funnels and
leave by the central.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the least alarm the animal is rapidly
withdrawn as far as the centre of the tube
(see the dotted line of the shell in the figure),
the surface slit and upper part of the tube
being obliterated. Each of the arms forms
a spiral with several coils (Fig. 5). The
<i>Lingulidæ</i> are of exceptional interest, in that
they furnish a very remarkable example of
“persistence of type.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shells of <i>Lingula</i> occur in the earliest
Palæozoic strata, and so closely resemble
those of the present day, that often no
difference can be observed either in the shape
of the valves or in the muscular impressions
on their inner surface (Fig. 6).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Lingula</i> occurs in the Indo-Pacific, Australia,
China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands.
<i>Glottidia</i>, a smaller form, with two small
curved plates on the brachial and a ridge on the peduncle valve,
is found on the American coast of the Pacific, and in the Atlantic.</p>

adherent to the rocks by the whole surface of the peduncle valve;
although this valve is so named, no peduncle or foramen is found in
this family. The Neotremata, like the <i>Lingulidæ</i>, are remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>examples of persistence of type, since forms very similar to the present

boxes about a third of an inch in length, shaped somewhat like a
pear cut in half (peduncle valve), and with a semicircular lid
(brachial valve) working on a hinge on the upper flat surface. The
foramen and peduncle are absent; but between the pointed end of
the peduncle valve and the hinge is an area filled in by a calcareous
plate characteristic of the Protremata.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brachial valve opens like the lid of a snuff-box, and shuts
down on the least alarm with the rapidity of lightning. The
peduncle valve is fixed on the rocks by its convex surface. The
species is common in the Mediterranean in from 30 to 300 fathoms,
and is also found in the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Order 4. <span class='sc'>Telotremata.</span>—This group, which at the present day
contains the largest number of species, includes the Lamp shells,
so called from their resemblance to an ancient lamp. The valves
are joined by a well-marked hinge, the peduncle passes through the
peduncle valve through a foramen completed by two plates secreted
by the mantle edges, and the brachial valve has attached to it a
calcareous scaffolding of processes or loops for the support of the
“arms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The shells in this group are frequently ridged. Their colour
is usually white, but sometimes red or yellow; deep-sea forms are
generally vitreous.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rhynchonella psittacea</i> has a black shell with a pointed incurved
beak; each of the arms forms a many coiled spiral and can be protruded
beyond the shell; the brachial skeleton is comparatively small
and simple, consisting of two separate processes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Terebratulina</i> the brachial skeleton forms a simple loop; in
<i>Magellania</i> the loop is reflected on itself (Fig. 2).</p>

<p class='c007'>The beautiful and unique specimen of <i>Dyscolia wyvillii</i>, from
390 fathoms W. Indies, is remarkable for its size, being over two
inches in length. The small vitreous specimens of <i>Terebratula

<p class='c007'>They occur in the form of cartilaginous or leathery sacs, fleshy incrustations,
solid fleshy masses, free-swimming, barrel-shaped animals,
solitary or united into chains or hollow cylinders; or, lastly, of minute
free-swimming tadpole-shaped organisms. To explain briefly the
structure of a Tunicate, <i>Ascidia mentula</i> (Fig. 1), is selected. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>animal, which lives on a muddy bottom, in from five to twenty fathoms,
resembles a conical sac fixed by the broader end, of grayish green
colour and about 4 inches in height. At the narrower end are two
orifices, one terminal—the branchial orifice or mouth, and the other
a little lower—the atrial orifice: the former has eight lobes and the
latter six.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Ascidian is undisturbed, the orifices are wide open, and
currents enter by the branchial and leave by the atrial orifice. On
the least alarm, the orifices close, jets of water being at the same
time squirted out; hence the popular name “Sea-squirts” given to
these animals.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>vertical section roughly shows the animal to be formed of three
concentric sacs (Figs. 2, 3). The outermost, which is tough and
membranous, is called the Test or Tunic, the whole group owing
its name to the presence of this protective covering.</p>

<p class='c007'>The middle sac, termed the Mantle, which almost corresponds
in shape to the outer, is composed of connective tissue, muscle-fibres,
blood-vessels, etc.; in spirit specimens, the mantle is shrunk away
from the test except at the orifices and at a point behind, where
vessels enter the test.</p>

orifice and along the ventral edge, but otherwise hangs free in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>interior, the space around and outside of the sac being termed the
atrial or peribranchial cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The delicate walls of the branchial sac, which resemble fine

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The margins of the stigmata are lined with cilia which set up
currents; and the water which enters by the branchial orifice, passes
through the stigmata into the atrial cavity, and thence out through
the atrial orifice. The walls of the branchial sac are chiefly composed
of a sieve-like meshwork of fine blood-vessels arranged in transverse
and longitudinal rows. The currents of water passing through the
stigmata aërate the blood in the vessels. Besides the stigmata, the
branchial sac has two relatively large orifices, viz., the branchial
orifice or mouth, and, at the opposite end, the opening into the
gullet. The branchial sac is, in fact, a capacious throat or pharynx
(Diagram Fig. 2 and Fig. 14). Inside the branchial orifice is a circle
of fine tentacles, which guard the entrance to the branchial sac. The
food of the animal consists of minute animal and vegetable organisms.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be wondered how this food is secured, seeing that the
currents of water are continually passing through the sieve-like
walls of the branchial sac to the exterior again. Within the
branchial orifice and above the branchial sac are two circular
ciliated ridges with a groove between, which is full of viscid
secretion; the cilia on the ridges direct particles into the groove
where they are retained by the mucus.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Passing backwards along the ventral edge of the branchial sac
is a thick-lipped furrow, which appears like a rod in the thin-walled
sac, and hence is called the endostyle. This organ secretes the
mucus which is carried up by ciliary action to the circular groove
in front of the branchial sac, and thence to the gullet along a fold
or crest, termed the dorsal lamina, situated along the dorsal edge of
the branchial sac.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gullet opens into a large stomach situated posteriorly on the
left side of the branchial sac. The stomach opens into the intestine,
which, after forming a loop, terminates in the anal orifice or vent
opening into the atrial cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tubular heart lies below the stomach, a remarkable feature
in the circulation consisting in the periodic reversal of the blood
current. An elongated nerve ganglion is situated between the
branchial and atrial orifices.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Ascidia mentula</i> is hermaphrodite. The egg develops into a
minute tadpole-like larva which swims about by means of its tail.
Water entering by the mouth passes out through the gill-slits. A
nerve-tube extending along the back and tail is swollen in front into
a brain-vesicle; and underneath the long nerve-tube behind the
brain is a stiff skeletal rod or axis—the notochord—which constitutes
the rudiment of a backbone. Inside the brain are two unpaired sense
organs, an eye and an organ of hearing (Fig. 5). After swimming
freely for a few hours, the larva settles down head foremost and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>fixes itself by papillæ on the anterior end (Figs. 6, 7). Presently
the tail becomes absorbed, and the posterior end of the nerve-tube,
and the brain with its eye and hearing organ, undergo atrophy, the
nerve ganglion of the adult alone representing the cerebrospinal
axis of the larva. The branchial sac and intestines develop greatly,
and growth proceeds in such a manner that the mouth is pushed
round to a position opposite to the fixed area, and gradually the
animal becomes the adult ascidian.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tadpole of an Ascidian resembles that of a frog (Figs. 8, 9),
not merely superficially, but also in its general structure and mode
of development. The Tunicata are now generally regarded as a
degenerate offshoot from the ancestral stock of the Vertebrata, in
that the larva possesses a skeletal rod (rudimentary backbone)
separating the dorsally situated nerve-tube (cerebrospinal axis) from
the ventrally situated intestinal tube, the existence of the cerebral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>eye in the Ascidian tadpole further tending to confirm the truth of
this theory. Apart from a knowledge of the course of their development,
Tunicata would have been classed among the Invertebrata,
but the structure of the larva clearly reveals the affinities of the
group to the backboned animals.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Ascidia mentula</i> belongs to the group of <span class='sc'>Simple Ascidians</span> which
are all fixed, and are either solitary or joined into colonies in which
each individual or ascidiozooid has a distinct test of its own. In the
<span class='sc'>Compound Ascidians</span>, which form colonies by budding, the ascidiozooids
are buried in a common investing mass and have no separate
tests. In a third group, the <span class='sc'>Salpa-like Ascidians</span>, the ascidiozooids
are united to form free-swimming colonies shaped like hollow cylinders
open at one end. The above three groups belong to one great
Order—the <span class='sc'>Ascidiacea</span>. A second Order, <span class='sc'>Thaliacea</span>, includes
the free-swimming <i>Salpa</i> and <i>Doliolum</i>, which exhibit alternation
of generations in their life history. A third Order <span class='sc'>Larvacea</span>,
includes very minute free-swimming forms which possess a tail in
the adult stage. There are sixteen families of Tunicata.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>Order I.—<span class='sc'>Ascidiacea.</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>The Ascidiacea include the great majority of species. With the
exception of the one genus <i>Pyrosoma</i>, they lead a fixed or stationary
life.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>Sub-order 1.</i>—<span class='sc'>Ascidiæ Simplices.</span></h4>

<p class='c017'>The Simple Ascidians are mostly solitary; in a few forms, however,
colonies arise by budding from stolons, but each individual has a distinct
test. The four families into which the sub-order is divided are
chiefly characterised by the nature of the test, the number of lobes round
the branchial and atrial orifice, and the character of the branchial sac.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the family <i>Molgulidæ</i> the tough membranous test is often
coated with sand; the branchial aperture is six-lobed, the atrial
four-lobed, the branchial sac has long folds or pleats, and the
stigmata are curved or arranged in spirals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><i>Molgula gigantea</i>, which is one of the largest of the Ascidians,
and which attains a length of over thirteen inches, forms a tough
conical sac; the branchial and atrial orifices at the upper end
have six and four lobes respectively. The test is leathery, smooth
above, but coated with sand below. The exhibited specimen,
which comes from the Straits of Magellan, has several specimens
of the stalked <i>Boltenia legumen</i> attached to the lower part of the
test.</p>

<p class='c007'>The curious <i>Molgula oculata</i> (Fig. 10) has a soft oval or rounded
body coated with sand. The branchial and atrial orifices have respectively
six and four lobes. Specimens grow attached to the rocks
and also live free in the sand. The surface of the test is provided
with hairs, which adhere to the rocks and collect particles of sand.
The adhesion not being very firm, specimens are easily detached by
currents and collected into heaps by the eddies; when living in the
sand only the two dark orifices are visible. The sand coating has
been supposed to confer protection by mimicry of the environment;
but Professor Lacaze Duthiers found, much to his chagrin, that
the sandy tests of his specimens were of no avail in securing them
from being devoured by crabs who seemed to scent their prey
from afar.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the family <i>Cynthiidæ</i> the test is usually leathery, the
branchial and atrial apertures four-lobed, and the branchial sac
folded into longitudinal pleats.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The genera <i>Boltenia</i> and <i>Culeolus</i> include species in which the
body is attached to a peduncle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large exhibited specimen of <i>Boltenia pachydermatina</i> is 28
inches in length, the head being 4 and the stalk 24 inches long.
The two four-lobed apertures are along one edge, the branchial
being the lower; the body is marked with long deep furrows, and
the stalk with transverse wrinkles. <i>Culeolus perlucidus</i>, from 1600
fathoms in the Southern Ocean, is in the form of a small pear-shaped
head on a slender stalk, the total length being 4½ inches.
The branchial orifice forms a transverse slit with raised lips near the
stalk, the slit-like atrial orifice being near the rounded end of the
body. <i>Culeolus moseleyi</i>, another slender-stalked form, was obtained
from 2425 fathoms in the Central Pacific.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little Cynthiid <i>Styelopsis grossularia</i> (Fig. 11), popularly
known as the “Currant Squirter,” occurs in the form of bright red
hemispherical blobs on stones and shells; when undisturbed, the
branchial and atrial orifices expand and project upwards. The eggs
are brilliant red in colour. Sir John Dalyell was the first to discover
the tadpole form, which is about ⅒ inch long (Fig. 11, B), and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>observe the tadpoles become fixed and develop into fixed Ascidians.
He calls the active little swimming larvæ “Spinulæ,” from their
resemblance to small pins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The family <i>Ascidiidæ</i> includes forms with a gelatinous or
cartilaginous test; the branchial and atrial orifices usually have 8
and 6 lobes respectively; the branchial sac is without folds.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Ascidia mentula</i>, described above, belongs to this family.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Chelyosoma</i> is characterised by the test forming tortoise-like
horny plates on the upper surface. The exhibited specimen of
<i>C. macleayanum</i> (Fig. 12) comes from Greenland; the upper hemispherical
part of the test is divided into 8 plates; the branchial and
atrial orifices are situated in the joints between the plates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fine specimen of <i>Phallusia mammillata</i> from Naples consists
of several individuals partly fused together; the branchial and
atrial orifices are wide open, and the mantle can be seen through the
thick knobby translucent test.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Rhodosoma</i> the test is modified so as to form stiff plates recalling
the valves of a bivalve shell. One plate is attached to the rocks,
the other closing against the first like a lid; the anterior end of the
animal with its branchial and atrial orifices is visible only when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>lid is open. The Mediterranean species <i>R. callense</i> (Fig. 13) grows
attached to the rocks. The little exhibited specimen is on a fragment
of shell in front of a black patch. The figure shows specimens with
the lid open and closed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Family <i>Clavelinidæ</i>. The body is attached to a creeping
stolon or mass of stolons, from which new individuals arise by
budding. The other three families of Simple Ascidians included
solitary forms, but the Clavelinidæ are social, and form colonies
wherein each individual has its own test.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Clavelina lepadiformis</i> (Fig. 14) forms graceful crystal vases about
an inch in height. The figure shows one individual, but usually
the processes at the base extend out as stolons whence other
individuals arise.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Diazona violacea</i>, from Cornwall, forms beautiful purple disk-shaped
colonies in which the ascidiozooids arise from a basal mass
of stolons. Sometimes the ascidiozooids die down, leaving only a
smooth violet pad, which in due time produces a new crop of ascidiozooids.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The remarkable <i>Rhopalæa neapolitana</i>, from Naples, may be
roughly compared to an hour-glass with a very long constriction.
The test is smooth in the upper part, but knobby and encrusted with
foreign bodies below. The upper or thoracic end contains the
branchial sac, and the lower or abdominal portion the stomach,
heart, and reproductive organs, the gullet and intestine traversing
the whole length of the narrow central region. Although from its
general structure <i>Rhopalæa</i> is a Clavelinid, it is not certainly known
to produce buds.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Perophora listeri</i> (Fig. 15) occurs in the form of little jelly-like
transparent blobs rising by short stalks from a silvery thread-like
stolon. Owing to their small size and transparency, it is possible to
examine specimens alive under the microscope, the currents passing
through the stigmata in the walls of the branchial sac, and the
beating of the heart being distinctly visible. The rapid motion of
the cilia surrounding stigmata gives the appearance of dark wheels
all rotating in the same direction. The heart beats so as to drive
the blood current so many times in one direction, and then after a
short pause, in the reverse direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The exhibited specimen growing on an oyster shell, is from
Plymouth.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>Sub-order 2.</i>—<span class='sc'>Ascidiæ Compositæ.</span></h4>

<p class='c017'>The Compound Ascidians are fixed forms, which give rise to
colonies by budding, the individuals being immersed in a common
mass and not possessing separate tests.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although reduced to an extremely small size each individual or
ascidiozooid of a colony possesses the same organs as a large Simple
Ascidian, excepting that the former does not possess a separate test.
Frequently the individuals of a colony are grouped into systems, in
which the atrial orifices open into a common cloaca. The little
ascidiozooids vary greatly in shape in the different families. In the
<i>Polyclinidæ</i>, for instance, they are long, the organs being so to speak,
drawn out, and being arranged in three regions, the thoracic, abdominal
and post-abdominal, the first region containing the branchial
sac, the second the stomach, and the third the heart and reproductive
organs. In the <i>Distomidæ</i>, the body exhibits two regions,
thoracic and abdominal, the heart and reproductive organs lying
alongside of the stomach. The <i>Botryllidæ</i> comprise only one region,
the stomach and the other organs being situated by the side of the
branchial sac.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The Compound Ascidians include seven families which are
characterised chiefly by the method of bud formation, and by the
arrangement of the organs into one, two, or three regions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only possible, from limits of space, to refer to a few interesting
forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The species of <i>Botryllus</i> are those most commonly met with.
They form richly coloured gelatinous incrustations on rocks and seaweeds.
<i>B. violaceus</i> (Figs. 16, 17, and 18 D) is blue with white lines;
<i>B. smaragdus</i>, green; <i>B. marionis</i>, brown with white and carmine; <i>B.
castaneus</i>, purple, and so on. The individuals are arranged in circular
systems with the branchial orifices round the circumference and the
atrial orifices opening into a common central cavity (Fig. 17), the
whole colony being composed of groups of systems.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Leptoclinum albidum</i> is a common and
widely distributed species; it occurs in the
form of thin white crusts. The glistening

alternation of generations in their life history. There are three
families, <i>Salpidæ</i>, <i>Octacnemidæ</i>, and <i>Doliolidæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Salpidæ.</i>—The Salpas are transparent barrel-shaped organisms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>which occur in abundance at the ocean surface. They are so
transparent that they are rarely seen, except in calm weather
from the side of small boats; yet they frequently swarm in
countless multitudes. From five to ten bands of muscles partially
or entirely surround the body, like hoops. The branchial and
atrial openings are at or near the opposite ends of the body.
The branchial sac has almost disappeared, the dorsal lamina and
ventral gutter (or endostyle) alone remaining, the interval between
the two on each side representing an enormous stigma; the
dorsal lamina, or “gill” is the transversely striated band passing
obliquely across the body and forming the only barrier between the
branchial and atrial cavities. Water enters at the mouth, and, by
the contraction of the muscle-hoops, is driven out through the atrial
aperture at the opposite end, which is then closed by a sphincter
muscle. The elastic walls of the body expand, and water again
enters through the mouth, the valve-like lips of which prevent its
being driven out that way. The <i>Salpa</i> swims along in jerks, and
along with each gulp of water takes in Radiolaria, Foraminifera, etc.,
which are retained by the mucus of the endostyle and carried to the
gullet. The <i>Salpa</i>, in fact, lives, as Professor Brooks observes, in a
“living broth,” so abundant is the food supply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intestines usually form an oval mass termed the “nucleus,”
which is a conspicuous object at the posterior end.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>solitary Salpa</i> above described is asexual. In the ventral
region of its body it forms a stolon which becomes segmented into a
series of buds (Fig. 21). As the stolon grows the end series of buds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>breaks off in the form of a chain and swims away, other chains being
detached in succession. A chain is formed of individuals arranged
in two rows, the individuals in each row being alternate (not opposite).</p>

<p class='c007'>Each individual of a chain differs from the solitary individual in
shape, arrangement of muscle bands, etc., but especially in having reproductive
organs. The chain Salpid is hermaphrodite; the embryo
develops into a solitary asexual <i>Salpa</i> which produces the chains by
budding. The wonderful life history of <i>Salpa</i> was discovered by the
poet Chamisso during a voyage round the world in 1819. He
observes: “A <i>Salpa</i> mother is not like its daughter or its own mother,
but resembles its sister, its granddaughter, and its grandmother.”
Here we have an example of “alternation of generations,” a sexual
generation (chain form) giving rise to an asexual generation (solitary
form), which latter produces the sexual generation.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the species of <i>Salpa</i> have double names owing to the
chain and solitary forms having been regarded as distinct species
before they were known to be phases in the life history of one and
the same species. <i>Salpa runcinata-fusiformis</i>, solitary form (Fig.
22 B), is barrel-shaped, truncated at each end, with terminal orifices,
and with nine muscle-bands on the dorsal surface, some of which
converge towards each other. An individual of a chain (Fig. 22 A)
is fusiform, with six muscle-bands, and with the orifices not terminal,
but at each end of the dorsal surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>The solitary form of <i>S. africana-maxima</i> is barrel-shaped,
with truncated ends and terminal orifices, and with nine broad
parallel muscle-bands. The chain form is conical at one end, with
six bands, and with orifices on the dorsal surface. The exhibited
specimen of the chain form, which is in an early stage of growth,
contains 202 individuals. The solitary and chain individuals of
<i>Salpa costata-tilesii</i> attain a length of six to eight inches. The
solitary form has eighteen muscle-bands and two large spines at the
posterior end. The individual of the chain has five muscle-bands.
A chain of three individuals is exhibited.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Salpa pinnata</i> produces a circular chain; the exhibited specimen
of the solitary form shows a small chain about to be detached; a
circular chain of six individuals is also exhibited. Species of <i>Salpa</i>
abound in all seas, but specimens from Naples have alone been
exhibited on account of their good preservation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Family <i>Octacnemidæ</i> includes <i>O. bythius</i>, a deep-sea Salpid, in which
the body forms a flattened disk produced into eight radiating lobes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Family <i>Doliolidæ</i>. The body is cask-shaped and surrounded by
circular hoops. The branchial and atrial orifices are at the opposite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>ends. The branchial sac is pierced by two oblique bands of stigmata
(Fig. 23 <i>sg</i>). The life history is very complicated. The egg
develops into a tailed larva, which develops into a “nurse”; the
latter is asexual, and produces three kinds of buds on a stolon, viz.
(1) nutritive buds which provide the “nurse” with food, (2) foster
forms which are set free as cask-shaped bodies with eight broad
muscle-bands, and (3) sexual forms which are attached for a time
to the foster forms, but which later become free and give rise
to the egg.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Larvacea are very minute Tunicata which live at the surface
and swim by means of a tail-like appendage, resembling in this and
certain other respects the tadpole larva of other Tunicata. They
are able to form a temporary test or “house” many times larger
than the body (Fig. 24). The organism itself, which is almost lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>in its large test, is the little hammer-shaped body in the centre of
the figure; the streaked areas bound a space in which the tail lashes
vigorously. The animal can leave its test and secrete another in a
few hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tail is attached to the under or ventral surface of the tiny
little barrel-shaped body, and usually points forwards; a skeletal rod,
the urochord, runs along its length. The branchial sac has two
ciliated openings or gill-clefts leading directly to the exterior, and
not opening like the stigmata of the other orders into an atrial
cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The order contains one family, the <i>Appendiculariidæ</i>, and four
genera, and is represented in all seas.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Oikopleura cophocerca</i>, one of the largest forms, is about half an
inch in length. The exhibited specimens came from St. Andrews,
Fife. Professor McIntosh reports that occasionally specimens of this
species occur in immense quantities, the tow-nets being filled with
them.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE STARFISH GALLERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the <span class='sc'>Starfish Gallery</span> is exhibited a series of the animals
belonging to the class <i>Echinoderma</i>; of these the Starfishes are the
best known, while others are the Sea-Lilies, Sea-Urchins, and Sea-Cucumbers
or Sea-Slugs.</p>

<p class='c007'>A small collection of various kinds of Worms is also exhibited in
this Gallery (Wall-cases I.–III.).</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ECHINODERMA.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Six table-cases contain the dried Echinoderms arranged in
systematic order. The seventh is devoted to preparations, models,
and figures illustrative of the structure and life history of various
members of the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>An inspection of that Case and the accompanying woodcuts will
make clear the distinctive characters of the Echinoderma. Unlike
that of a Crayfish or a Mussel, the body does not appear to be divided
into two equal or symmetrical halves, though it really is; this is due
to the possession of a number of rays, of which there are ordinarily
five. The skin is strengthened by the deposition in it of carbonate
of lime, which may be in the form of continuous plates or bars,
or of separate scattered spicules. A series of tube-feet or suckers
(podia) are generally developed along each ray, and these are
supplied by a system of water-vessels peculiar to Starfish and their
allies. These rays are often called “<i>ambulacra</i>.”</p>

<p>Fig. 3.<br>  <br>  Figure of a Starfish (<i>Asterias rubens</i>).<br>  <br>  In the ray marked I. the skin has been removed from the upper surface, and the ambulacral ossicles (<i>ao</i>) and the podia (<i>s</i>) are seen <i>in situ</i>; the blind outgrowths (<i>c</i>) from the central stomach (<i>sp</i>) have been dissected out. In II. the gonads (<i>g</i>) are exposed; and in the centre above the stomach the rectal glands (<i>rg</i>) are to be seen. The anus (<i>a</i>) is seen to be subcentral in position.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>In the body of the Starfish (Fig. 3) the arms are seen to be
continuous with the disk and to contain portions or prolongations
of the chief organs. The middle of the arm is occupied by two
rows of hard pieces (ambulacral ossicles), the fellows of which make
an open angle with each other, and so form an open ambulacral
groove; along this we find the suckers, the water-canal that
supplies them, the blood-vessel of the arm, and a nerve-cord. At
the centre of the disk is the mouth. The ossicles at the sides of
the arms bear spines, which vary in different species; the surface
of the back is supported by a network of hard pieces, and through
the intervening spaces there project membranous pouches, which
are respiratory in function. The modified plate on the upper
surface opens into a tube by means of which the water-vessels
communicate with the exterior; this plate is known as the madreporite
(Fig. 2, <i>m</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The organs for masticating the food are most highly developed
in the regular Echinoids, where the complex apparatus known as
the “Lantern of Aristotle” is found (Case 38) to consist of five
sets of pieces; the tooth is strong and bevelled at its free end; it
is supported by triangular jaws on either side, a pair uniting and
having the form of an inverted pyramid; these alveoli are connected
with their neighbours by oblong pieces (<i>falces</i>); above these
there are elongated bars, which are hinged on to the inner end of
the falces and have their outer ends free. The whole lantern is
connected to the test by muscles which pass from its sides to the
auricles or upstanding pillars which lie round the mouth; and, owing
to this muscular apparatus, the teeth are capable of complicated and
various movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Ophiuroids the edges of the mouth-slits are provided with
short spinous processes, varying a good deal in arrangement, but
never having, apparently, any other function than that of a filtering-apparatus;
in the Starfishes the plates round the mouth have a supporting
function only; in Crinoids and Holothurians the mouth is
unarmed; the latter are often remarkable for a deposit of calcareous
plates in the walls of the gullet, and in the former the grooves on the
arms are the lines along which food comes to the mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Echinoids live on seaweeds and the animals that are found on them;
such as have no teeth, like <i>Spatangus</i> (Case 32), use their spout-like
mouth to take up the sand and débris on which they move, and from
which they extract some nutriment. Ophiuroids live on the smaller
foraminifera; Asteroids on dead fishes (as line-fishermen well know),
oysters, and other molluscs, and even on specimens of their own
particular species; Holothurians on shell or coral débris and the
minute organisms it contains; and Crinoids on small tests of
foraminifera and on the adults of small and larvæ of larger
crustacea.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>In a number of Echinoids and Asteroids some of the spines are
specially modified to act as seizing-organs—the free end being
divided into two, three, or rarely four pieces, which are moved on
one another by special muscles. These minute organs were regarded
by earlier observers as parasites, and were named <i>pedicellariæ</i>; they
may be movable, when they have a stalk, or the stalk may be absent
and the valves sessile. Considerable difficulty attaches to the determination
of the use that these organs may be to their possessors;
but there is reason to suppose that they may act as cleansing-organs
by removing minute particles of dirt, and as temporary organs of
fixation, while M. Prouho has observed their use as organs of defence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Echinoderms move but little; the unstalked Crinoids, if they
cannot find stones or worm-tubes around which to attach themselves,
swim by beating the water with their delicate arms, five being
raised and five depressed alternately. The Echinoid or Asteroid is
able to move by the aid of its podia or so-called ambulacral feet,
which become erected by being filled with water, and are then
contracted; by means of this contraction movement is effected; a
similar kind of locomotion obtains with the pedate Holothurians;
in the Ophiuroids the flexible arms either serve as the organs of
movement, or act as an apparatus whereby the creature becomes
coiled round the branches of corals (see Case 20).</p>

<p class='c007'>Echinoderms are often of exceedingly bright colours, as is shown
by the pictures on the wall, and are very conspicuous objects; this
may, apparently, be associated with disagreeable tastes or odours;
sometimes they cover themselves over with seaweed, and so hide their
brilliancy; the spines of some forms are exceedingly painful to the
touch, and the stout plates of some of the <i>Goniasters</i> must form
admirable organs of protection. The power of restoring lost or injured
parts is one of the most remarkable points in the Echinoderm
organization (see Case 6).</p>

<p class='c007'>Echinoderms are of great geological age, and were very abundant
in earlier periods of the world’s history. Two groups (the Blastoids
and Cystids) have completely disappeared, and the Stalked Crinoids
(Lily-Encrinites) are far less common than they used to be. Echinoderms
are now found in all seas, and extend to great depths of
ocean; many of the species have exceedingly wide areas of distribution,
and most are characterized by their gregarious habits, a large
number of specimens of a single species being generally obtained by
the dredge. They are most abundant in the tropical seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most Echinoderms lay their eggs in the water, where the larvæ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>are developed and swim about freely; but in a few (<i>Hemiaster</i>,
<i>Ophiacantha vivipara</i>, and others) the young do not pass through
any metamorphosis, for the eggs are placed in special pouches of
the body of the parent, in which they are hatched. The free-swimming
larvæ of the other Echinoderms pass through a series
of remarkable changes (Figs. 4 and 5); these are illustrated by the
twelve models of various forms of larvæ exhibited in Case 36; in
Case 35 is a set of models showing in detail the changes undergone
by a single species (<i>Asterina gibbosa</i>). A portion only of the
body of the larva is converted into the substance of the perfect
animal; the rest is either absorbed by the growing animal, or
shrivels up and disappears.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Below the twelve models in Case 36 may be seen a representation
of three stages in the history of the Feather-star (<i>Antedon bifida</i>).
The larvæ of this Echinoderm are not free, but are attached by a
stalk (Fig. 6); in the common Feather-star and other <i>Comatulidæ</i>
the stalk is found during larval stages only; in others, such as
<i>Pentacrinus</i>, it persists throughout life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The presence or absence of this stalk has been taken as the first
character of importance in the classification of Echinoderma which
may be divided into two groups:—</p>

<p class='c007'>A. <span class='sc'>Pelmatozoa</span>,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> or Echinoderms provided with a stalk throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>life or in the larval stages only. To this group belong the
<i>Crinoidea</i>, and the extinct <i>Blastoidea</i>, and <i>Cystidea</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>B. <span class='sc'>Echinozoa</span>, or Echinoderms without stalks at any time of
their existence. To this group belong the <i>Asteroidea</i>, <i>Ophiuroidea</i>,
<i>Echinoidea</i>, and <i>Holothurioidea</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Crinoidea.</span>—This Order may be described as stalked, globular,
or cup-shaped Echinoderms, in which the oral surface of the calyx
or disk looks upwards, and in which five jointed and generally
branched rays arise from the central disk. Their joints have jointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>pinnules at their sides, and the sucking-feet have the form of
tentacles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stalked representatives of this Order are placed on tables and
brackets near the south door, and are worthy of being particularly
noticed for their fine preservation, size, and beauty. The largest
specimen of <i>Pentacrinus decorus</i> was taken on a telegraph-wire,
to the covering of which the stalk of the Crinoid is still attached.
<i>Metacrinus</i> is a more lately discovered genus, which appears to be
confined to the eastern seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few dried unstalked Crinoids are shown in Table-case 1;
these show the leading modifications of structure in the two great
genera <i>Antedon</i> and <i>Actinometra</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 7.<br>  <br>  Comet form of <i>Linckia</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Asteroidea.</span>—This Order comprises Echinoderms with a depressed
body of pentagonal or star-like shape, to the ventral surface
of which the ambulacral feet are confined. The rays are more or
less elongate movable arms, with skeletal structures, which consist
of transversely arranged, paired, calcareous plates, articulated with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>each other like vertebræ, the series extending from the mouth to the
end of the arms. The groove in which the ambulacral feet are
arranged is uncovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typical specimens of this Order are exhibited in Cases 2 &#38; 3, in
which the great variety of form in the genus <i>Asterias</i> and beautiful
examples of <i>Acanthaster</i> are shown. Cases 6 &#38; 7 contain specimens
illustrating the curious habit of self-mutilation possessed by so many
Echinoderms; among Starfishes, and notably in the genus <i>Linckia</i>,
the single arms separated from the disk are able to develop a fresh
disk and arms, and so to multiply the species. Cases 9–11 contain
fine series of <i>Oreaster</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Ophiuroidea</span>, or “Brittle-stars.”—These Echinoderms appear to
resemble the ordinary Starfish<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a>; but they differ in having the organs
of digestion, respiration, and reproduction confined to the disk, the
arms having merely the function of locomotor organs. The arms
therefore are more slender and cylindrical in form, and are sharply
distinct from the disk; the separate joints consist of two central
ossicles, which leave only a narrow canal between them, and these are
covered above, below, and at the sides by specially developed investing
plates; the lateral plates bear spines, which are always comparatively
short and delicate, as compared with the spines found at the sides of
the arm in starfishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal types of this Order are exhibited in Cases 17–22;
the most exquisite of them are the forms whose arms are divided and
subdivided till they end at last in the finest threads, as in <i>Astrophyton</i>,
the so-called Basket-fish or Gorgon’s heads.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Echinoidea</span>, or “Sea-Urchins,” are Echinoderms in which the
rays are not free, as in the Starfishes or Brittle-stars, but unite to
form a compact, spherical, heart- or disk-shaped test; this test is
covered with spines, which may attain to a great length, as is shown
in the fine example of <i>Diadema saxatile</i> from the Andaman Islands;
some of the tests are flexible and very fragile. Owing to the quantity
of specimens that are sometimes dredged at one spot, the naturalist
has been able to gain a better idea of the range of variation in the
species of Echinoderms than in some other divisions of the Animal
Kingdom; an instructive series, showing the variations of <i>Echinometra
lucunter</i>, is shown in Case 28.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>The genus <i>Hemiaster</i> offers an example of an Echinoderm in
which the eggs are laid in special pouches; the hinder ambulacra are
deepened to form pits, which are guarded by specially elongated
spines (see Case 34); in these pits the young pass through all the
stages of their development.</p>

<p class='c007'>The minute structure of the spines of Sea-Urchins is illustrated
by a series of figures on the wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <span class='sc'>Holothurioidea</span>, or Sea-Cucumbers, form the last order of
Echinoderms. Their body, as indicated by their English name, is
elongate, subcylindrical, with a more or less flexible integument,
according to the extent of the reduction of the calcareous skeleton;
the mouth is at one end of the body and surrounded by tentacles,
the vent at the opposite end.</p>

<p class='c007'>As these animals cannot be shown in a dried state, some of them,
preserved in spirit, are placed in Wall-Case IV. According as they
have or have not the sucking-feet of the Echinoderma, they are
ordinarily divided into the <i>Pedata</i> and the <i>Apoda</i>; the latter are
represented by <i>Synapta</i>, which may attain to a great length, and
by <i>Chiridota</i>; the Pedata are illustrated by the genera <i>Cucumaria</i>,
<i>Psolus</i>, and <i>Holothuria</i>. Deep-sea investigations have revealed the
existence of another group of specially modified Holothurians—the
<i>Elasipoda</i>; these are remarkable for their well-marked bilateral
symmetry and the distinctness between the dorsal and ventral

  <h2 class='c005'>WORMS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By the name “Worms,” people commonly indicate a number of
different forms whose relations with one another are by no means
so close as those of a Holothurian and a Crinoid, or a Mussel and
an Octopus. There are not, indeed, any common characters by the
possession of which the worm-like animals can at once be distinguished
from other animals. We take the divisions, examples of
which are here represented, either by drawings, models, or specimens
preserved in spirit separately.</p>

<p class='c007'>The groups referred to may be enumerated as follows:—</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009 bbt' rowspan='3'><i>Platyhelmia.</i></td>
 <td class='blt c011'>Turbellaria.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009'><i>Chætopoda.</i></td>
 <td class='blt c011'>&#160;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Platyhelmia</span>, or Flat-Worms.—These form the lowest and
simplest division of the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>The parasitic Platyhelmia—the Tapeworms (<i>Cestoda</i>) and the
Flukes (<i>Trematoda</i>)—occupy Case I.; the life history of the common
Tapeworm (<i>Tænia solium</i>) is shown by the aid of models and figures.
A model of the anterior end of the common Tapeworm shows the
four suckers and the crown of hooks; the unjointed neck is followed
by the joints (<i>proglottids</i>), which increase in size the farther they
are from the neck. Several entire specimens of <i>Tænia</i> follow,
showing the size of the whole worm and the form of its joints.
The structure of the body is shown in the models of two joints.
The growth and development of the <i>Tapeworm</i> is dependent on a
migration or a change of the hosts which it inhabits in the various
stages of its life; and although the different kinds of Tapeworm
differ from each other somewhat in certain details of their migration
and development, their life history exhibits, on the whole, the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>events which we find in <i>Tænia solium</i>, a common Tapeworm of man
in Northern Europe. This worm is matured in the intestines of
man; its final joints consist merely of
fertilized ova which have already passed
through the earlier stages of development;
when the joints are detached and discharged,
their contents escape in the form
of embryos contained in a thick chitinous
shell. If these are now swallowed by a
pig, the shell is digested by the gastric
juices of the new host, and a rounded
embryo, which is provided with three
pairs of hooks, is set free; by means of
these hooks the guest makes its way
through the wall of the stomach or
intestine, and finally settles down in the
muscles of its host. The embryo now
loses its hooks, and gradually acquires a
bladder-like form, the central cavity of
which is filled with fluid. This bladder-worm
(<i>Cysticercus</i>) has its outer wall
pushed inwards at the anterior end, and
on this hooks and suckers become developed.
We have now a narrow head
and neck with an attached bladder, the
head being at this time hollow. If during
the long time that these bladder-worms
remain alive, the pig is killed for food,
its flesh is found to be “measly”; if it
is afterwards insufficiently cooked and
eaten, the worms are conveyed into the
human stomach. Here the bladder-like
termination becomes absorbed, and, the
neck beginning to grow, we have the commencement of the form
from which we started, and the completion of that “vicious circle”
which is so curious a characteristic of many forms of parasitic life.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In other Tapeworms the cyst may be more complicated than that
in the pig, as, for example, the form found in the sheep’s brain or
the liver of the horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the other Cestode parasites mention should specially be made
of those of Fishes; the vulgar notion that the parasites of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>animals are dangerous to man has been shown to be entirely
erroneous.</p>

<div id='i_p118'  class='figcenter id095'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 9.<br>  <br>  <i>Limnæa truncatula.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Flukes</i> infest animals of all kinds; that which is most
dangerous to sheep, and the cause of much pecuniary loss (<i>Distoma
hepaticum</i>), is selected here as a type; its structure is shown by a
large model, and its life history by a series of diagrams (Figs. 10–13).
Here, again, we have a creature which infests two hosts. If the
larvæ which escape from the sheep fall on wet
ground in or near a pool, they make their way
to a small pond-snail (<i>Limnæa truncatula</i>, Fig. 9),
into the lung-chamber of which they bore their
way. On leaving them the larva may be, and
is, too frequently, eaten by a sheep, and makes
its way into the liver of that animal, where it causes the disease
known as the “liver rot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The damage done by the liver-fluke may be imagined from the
fact that in the winter of 1879–80 no less than three millions of
sheep died of rot in the United Kingdom; this heavy loss is no
doubt largely due to the immense number of eggs to which a single
fluke may give rise. It has been estimated that every fluke may
produce, during its life, several thousands of eggs; and in one case
Prof. A. P. Thomas found as many as 7,400,000 eggs in the gall-bladder
of a sheep which was suffering from rot, and which, at that
time, had in its liver about 200 flukes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>non-parasitic</i> Flat-worms are shown, magnified, in the upper
parts of Cases I. &#38; II. The <i>Turbellaria</i> proper, without any or
with a simple or a branched intestine, but without a vent, are
represented by <i>Convoluta</i> and <i>Thysanozoon</i>: the general structure is
shown by a diagram in Case II., which is here reproduced (Fig. 14).
<i>Planaria</i>, <i>Thysanozoon</i>, and <i>Bipalium</i> serve to illustrate the forms
of members of this group.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nemertine Worms (<i>Nemertinea</i>), with a straight intestine,
with a vent, and with a proboscis, may attain to a very considerable
length; <i>Carinella</i> and <i>Lineus</i> are represented by large figures, and
various species are shown in spirit. These forms, which used to be
very unsatisfactory to exhibit, on account of the great difficulty of
preserving them complete and uninjured, are now, with improved
methods, very satisfactorily shown, as the specimens purchased from
the Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth prove.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Nematodes</span> (Thread-Worms or Round-Worms).—These are for
the most part parasitic, and infest plants as well as animals; the
common Round-Worms living parasitically in man (<i>Ascaris</i>, <i>Stronaylus</i>,
<i>Trichocephalus</i>) belong to this Order. Sometimes they are
parasitic in their early stages and later live a free life—such are
<i>Gordius</i> and <i>Mermis</i>. A specimen of a Mantid is exhibited from
which half the body of the infesting <i>Gordius</i> has already protruded
(Fig. 17). One of the most remarkable <i>Gordii</i> is the great elongated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span><i>G. fulgur</i>, or “Lightning Snake,” from Celebes. Another very large
Nematode is the so-called Guinea-worm, or <i>Dracunculus medinensis</i>,
which is found beneath the skin of the leg; it is very possible that
this worm was the cause of the illness which afflicted the Israelites in
their journey through the desert from Egypt to the Promised Land.</p>

<p>Fig. 18.<br>  <br>  Figure of <i>Trichina spiralis</i>, showing the worms encysted in muscle.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Of all Nematodes the most dangerous to man is the small worm
which is known as <i>Trichina spiralis</i> (Fig. 18); a series of models are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>shown which give a good idea of the structure of the female and the
smaller male. The young make their way through the walls of the
stomach of their host, and encyst themselves among its muscles: a
piece of a sternothyroid muscle is shown, taken from a man in whose
body it was calculated there were forty millions of encysted <i>Trichinæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other Nematodes infesting man, such as <i>Filaria sanguinis
hominis</i>, are too small for exhibition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plants are not free from the attacks of Nematodes, and examples
are shown, accompanied by an illustrating figure, of the Ear-cockle
gall of wheat; this gall is due to the injuries inflicted by a minute
Thread-worm—<i>Tylenchus tritici</i>. Wheat is, of course, by no means
the only cultivated plant that is attacked by these minute worms;
the history of most has, however, still to be made out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holding a somewhat uncertain position in relation to the Round-worms
are the parasitic <i>Acanthocephali</i> (Thorn-headed Worms) and
the free-swimming <i>Chætognatha</i>, or Bristle-jawed Worms; examples
of both of these groups are shown, together with diagrams illustrative
of their general structure.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Annulata</span> or Chætopoda.—So-called because consisting of a
series of rings, and being provided with chætæ or bristles; they
are to be associated with the Arthropoda, under the one head
“Appendiculata,” a better name than “Articulata,” since Cuvier did
not include worms in his group. The creatures that are most
familiarly called worms are to be found in Case III.; here are a
few examples of the numerous kinds of worms that are found living
freely in the sea, of earth and freshwater Worms, and of Leeches.
All these worms are distinctly characterized by the fact that they
consist of a number of definite rings (somites), whence they have
been called <i>Annulata</i>. The marine Worm and the Earthworm differ
from the Leech in that these rings are provided with chætæ or
bristles, of which there are a number in each bundle in the marine,
and a few only in the terrestrial or freshwater form: hence the
marine Worms are called <i>Polychæta</i> and the latter <i>Oligochæta</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The former are divisible into two great groups. There are those
that are free-swimming and are able to forage for themselves, such
as the lovely Sea-mouse (<i>Aphrodite aculeata</i>), the large <i>Eunice
gigantea</i>, the common <i>Nereis pelagica</i>, or the exquisitely coloured
<i>Chloeia flava</i>. Others live a more retired life, dwelling in tubes,
which they fashion for themselves; they lead either a solitary or
a social life. Here we have examples of <i>Sabella</i>, <i>Sabellaria</i>, <i>Serpula</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>a number of forms of worm-tubes, showing their great variety
and beauty (see especially the delicate <i>Filograna</i>), are to be seen in
the small Table-cases placed against the north wall of the Gallery.
Attention should be especially directed to Mr. A. T. Watson’s
beautiful preparations of <i>Terebella littoralis</i>. We give a figure (Fig. 19)
after a drawing by that gentleman of the home of <i>Panthalis oerstedi</i>,
the tube-forming habits of which have been carefully observed by him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>The <i>Oligochæta</i> are represented by the common Earthworm, the
influence of which in the formation of mould and in the general
ploughing of the soil was carefully investigated by Mr. Darwin;
and by the little <i>Tubifex rivulorum</i> (Bloodworm), which owes both
its red colour and its ability to dwell in mud, which is so poor
in oxygen as to be unfit for respiration, to the same chemical
compound as that which gives the red colour to our blood and
carries the oxygen of respiration all over the body.</p>

<p><i>Acanthobdella</i>: <i>e</i>, eyes; <i>ch</i>, chætæ; <i>s</i>, sucker.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Hirudinea</i>, or Leeches, are often said to be distinguished
from the <i>Chætopoda</i> by the absence of bristles, but, as a fact,
<i>Acanthobdella</i> (Figs. 21 and 22) has very well marked bristles. They
always have a sucker at the hinder end of the body by which they
are attached to their prey; they are found in fresh water (<i>Piscicola</i>),
on sea-fishes (as <i>Pontobdella</i>), or in moist places, as the Leech
(<i>Hirudo</i>). The last-named has three jaws, armed with as many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>as ninety denticles. <i>Trochetia subviridis</i> (Land-Leech) is a species
which is found rarely and sporadically in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Myzostomaria form a division of Polychæta all the members
of which live parasitically on Crinoids, and otherwise present great
differences in their habits. Some move about freely on the Crinoids
they infest, others are more sluggish and rarely move, others produce
galls or cysts on their host, and yet others are internal parasites, and
live in the alimentary canal. It is of interest to note that there
are corresponding degrees of difference between the young and
old specimens of the different groups of species.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general organisation of Myzostomaria is shown in the
accompanying figure (Fig. 23) in which the dorsal wall of the body
is supposed to be transparent so as to allow of the chief internal
organs being seen.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The last group of Worms here represented is that of the
<i>Gephyrea</i>; with the advance of our knowledge it is probable that
they will be found to be more intimately allied to the <i>Annulata</i>
than is now generally supposed; it will be seen indeed that
<i>Echiurus</i> has bristles at its hinder end; <i>Sipunculus</i> is the best
known representative of the unarmed <i>Gephyrea</i>; <i>Bonellia</i> is interesting
both from the fact that it owes its green colour to a matter
closely resembling the chlorophyll of green plants, and from the
possession by the female of a proboscis, which is protruded from
the hole in the rock occupied by the worm: the male is very much
smaller than the female, and is not nearly so well developed. Owing
to the mode of lighting the Gallery, the visitor may have to shift
his position several times before gaining a good view of the whole
length of the proboscis.</p>
